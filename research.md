## About Me

Tiffany Bao is an Assistant Professor at Arizona State University.
Her research interests are __aspects of software security__, including techniques, measurements, and strategies to discover, assess, and defend software vulnerabilities.
Tiffany Bao received her Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Prof. [David Brumley](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~dbrumley/).


## What are Aspects of Software Security?

Traditionally, software security is defined as techniques that identify and patch vulnerabilities from software programs.
As software security research advances, researchers have realized that techniques are not sufficient to achieve the security of software.
A vulnerability is not well defended until it is patched.

Throughout the life of a vulnerability --- from being discovered to being patched --- it involves not only automatic techniques, but also strategic decisions from multiple agents, such as software vendors who develop and release a patch, victim users who deploy a patch, and malicious attackers who exploit the vulnerability.

Therefore, to achieve software security, we need to study both __techniques__ and __tactics__ about software vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the decisions on a software vulnerability depends on many __factors__, such as the likelihood of being exploited, the severity of the vulnerability --- which I call the techniques, tactics, and the measurement of the related factors the __aspects of software security__.
