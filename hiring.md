## How to contact me?

You are welcome to email me at [tbao@asu.edu](tbao@asu.edu) with your CV, github account, and/or code example.

You still need to submit an application to [ASU Ph.D. Program](https://cidse.engineering.asu.edu/graduate-admissions/).
You are welcome to put me as your preferred advisor.

## General suggestions

If you are looking for a Ph.D. or a postdoc position, I --- who applied to Ph.D. programs before and reviews hundreds of applications --- do have some suggestions that might help you with your application.

1. Be proactive and self-motivated.

   Professors appreciate your independence in doing research.
   Rather than a student who does what the professors suggest, we prefer the one who understands the rationales of the advice and can make right decisions by itself. 
   
   I know this is hard, especially when you just start.
   However, proactivity and self-motivation are essential natures towards an independent researcher.
   So show it to whom you hope to work with for your Ph.D.


1. Have a clear goal for your future research and career.

   Professors hope to know about your plan.
   You don't have to say you want to become a professor if that is not your plan.
   What we really care are you clearly know why you want a Ph.D. and you are determined to get it.  
   

1. Show how your past experiences help you with your goal.

   Your experience decides who you are.
   Besides your expertise and skills, professors hope to see your past efforts in achieving your goal.
   We love people who act.

Good luck!
