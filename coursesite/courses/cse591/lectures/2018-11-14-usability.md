title: Making Security Usable
category: Human Factors
prof: Bryan
summary: >
  The most secure system in the world can be subverted if
  users can't employ it correctly (or if they themselves are subverted!).
  This lecture will cover usable design, with case studies drawn from
  security warnings, authentication, and phishing.  We will also cover
  attacks and defenses based on social engineering.
