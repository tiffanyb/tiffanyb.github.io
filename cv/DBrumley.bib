abstract = {Layout randomization is a powerful, popular technique for software protection. We present it and study it in programming-language terms. More specifically, we consider layout randomization as part of an implementation for a highlevel programming language; the implementation translates this language to a lower-level language in which memory addresses are numbers. We analyze this implementation, by relating low-level attacks against the implementation to contexts in the high-level programming language, and by establishing full abstraction results.},

abstract = {It is widely believed that for many optimization problems, no algorithm is substantially more efficient than exhaustive search. This means that finding optimal solutions for many practical problems is completely beyond any current or projected computational capacity. To understand the origin of this extreme 'hardness', computer scientists, mathematicians and physicists have been investigating for two decades a connection between computational complexity and phase transitions in random instances of constraint satisfaction problems. Here we present a mathematically rigorous method for locating such phase transitions. Our method works by analysing the distribution of distances between pairs of solutions as constraints are added. By identifying critical behaviour in the evolution of this distribution, we can pinpoint the threshold location for a number of problems, including the two most-studied ones: random k-SAT and random graph colouring. Our results prove that the heuristic predictions of statistical physics in this context are essentially correct. Moreover, we establish that random instances of constraint satisfaction problems have solutions well beyond the reach of any analysed algorithm.},

abstract = {Attacks often exploit memory errors to gain control over the execution of vulnerable programs. These attacks remain a serious problem despite previous research on techniques to prevent them. We present write integrity testing (WIT), a new technique that provides practical protection from these attacks. WIT uses points-to analysis at compile time to compute the control-flow graph and the set of objects that can be written by each instruction in the program. Then it generates code instrumented to prevent instructions from modifying objects that are not in the set computed by the static analysis, and to ensure that indirect control transfers are allowed by the control-flow graph. To improve coverage where the analysis is not precise enough, WIT inserts small guards between the original program objects. We describe an efficient implementation with optimizations to reduce space and time overhead. This implementation can be used in practice because it compiles C and C++ programs without modifications, it has high coverage with no false positives, and it has low overhead. WIT's average runtime overhead is only 7% across a set of CPU intensive benchmarks and it is negligible when IO is the bottleneck.},

TLS has become the de facto secure protocol of choice for Internet and mobile applications. DTLS is a variant of TLS that is growing in importance. In this paper, we present distinguishing and plaintext recovery attacks against TLS and DTLS. The attacks are based on a delicate timing analysis of decryption processing in the two protocols. We include experimental results demonstrating the feasibility of the attacks in realistic network environments for several differ- ent implementations of TLS and DTLS, including the leading OpenSSL implementations. We provide countermeasures for the attacks. Finally, we discuss the wider implications of our attacks for the cryptographic design used by TLS and DTLS},

abstract = {Binary analysis is useful in many practical applications, such as the detection of malware or vulnerable software components. However, our survey of the literature shows that most existing binary analysis tools and frameworks rely on assumptions about specific compilers and compilation settings. It is well known that techniques such as refactoring and light obfuscation can significantly alter the structure of code, even for simple programs. Applying such techniques or changing the compiler and compilation settings can significantly affect the accuracy of available binary analysis tools, which severely limits their practicability, especially when applied to malware. To address these issues, we propose a novel technique that extracts the semantics of binary code in terms of both data and control flow. Our technique allows more robust binary analysis because the extracted semantics of the binary code is generally immune from light obfuscation, refactoring, and varying the compilers or compilation settings. Specifically, we apply data-flow analysis to extract the semantic flow of the registers as well as the semantic components of the control flow graph, which are then synthesized into a novel representation called the semantic flow graph (SFG). Subsequently, various properties, such as reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, and transitive relations, are extracted from the SFG and applied to binary analysis. We implement our system in a tool called BinGold and evaluate it against thirty binary code applications. Our evaluation shows that BinGold successfully determines the similarity between binaries, yielding results that are highly robust against light obfuscation and refactoring. In addition, we demonstrate the application of BinGold to two important binary analysis tasks: binary code authorship attribution, and the detection of clone components across program executables. The promising results suggest that BinGold can be used to enhance existing techniques, making them more robust and practical.},

abstract = {Determination of data dependences is a task typically performed with high-level language source code in today's optimizing and parallelizing compilers. Very little work has been done in the field of data dependence analysis on assembly language code, but this area will be of growing importance, e.g. for increasing ILP. A central element of a data dependence analysis in this case is a method for memory reference disambiguation which decides whether two memory operations may/must access the same memory location. In this paper we describe a new approach for determination of data dependences in assembly code. Our method is based on a sophisticated algorithm for symbolic value propagation, and it can derive value-based dependences between memory operations instead of address-based dependences, only. We have integrated our method into the salto system for assembly language optimization. Experimental results show that our approach greatly improves the accuracy of the dependence analysis in many cases. <a id="expcoll43" href="JavaScript:},

abstract = {A key challenge in teaching a procedural skill is ﬁnding an effective progression of example problems that the learner can solve in order to internalize the procedure. In many learning domains, generation of such problems is typically done by hand and there are few tools to help automate this process. We reduce this effort by borrowing ideas from test input generation in software engineering and show how we can use execution traces as a framework for abstracting the characteristics of a given procedure and deﬁning a partial ordering that reﬂects the relative difﬁculty of two traces. We also show how we can use this framework to analyze the completeness of expert-designed progressions and ﬁll in holes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our framework can automatically synthesize new problems by generating large sets of problems for elementary and middle school mathematics and synthesizing hundreds of levels for a popular algebra-learning game. We present the results of a user study with this game conﬁrming that our partial ordering can predict user evaluation of procedural difﬁculty better than baseline methods.},

As distributed systems are assembled from machines belonging to principals with divergent interests, we find that incentives are becoming as important as technical design in achieving dependability. The new field provides valuable insights not just into "security" topics (such as bugs, spam, phishing, and law enforcement strategy) but into more general areas such as the design of peer-to-peer systems, the optimal balance of effort by programmers and testers, why privacy gets eroded, and the politics of digital rights management.},

abstract = {Static analysis examines code in the absence of input data and without running the code. It can detect potential security violations (SQL injection), runtime errors (dereferencing a null pointer) and logical inconsistencies (a conditional test that can't possibly be true). Although a rich body of literature exists on algorithms and analytical frameworks used by such tools, reports describing experiences in industry are much harder to come by.

@article{Balzarotti2008a,
abstract = {Web applications are ubiquitous, perform mission- critical tasks, and handle sensitive user data. Unfortunately, web applications are often implemented by developers with limited security skills, and, as a result, they contain vulnerabilities. Most of these vulnerabilities stem from the lack of input validation. That is, web applications use malicious input as part of a sensitive operation, without having properly checked or sanitized the input values prior to their use. Past research on vulnerability analysis has mostly focused on identifying cases in which a web application directly uses external input in critical operations. However, little research has been performed to analyze the correctness of the sanitization process. Thus, whenever a web application applies some sanitization routine to potentially malicious input, the vulnerability analysis assumes that the result is innocuous. Unfortunately, this might not be the case, as the sanitization process itself could be incorrect or incomplete. In this paper, we present a novel approach to the analysis of the sanitization process. More precisely, we combine static and dynamic analysis techniques to identify faulty sanitization procedures that can be bypassed by an attacker. We implemented our approach in a tool, called Saner, and we applied it to a number of real-world applications. Our results demonstrate that we were able to identify several novel vulnerabilities that stem from erroneous sanitization procedures.},

abstract = {The pervasive presence of interconnected objects enables new communication paradigms where devices can easily reach each other while interacting within their environment. The so-called Internet of Things (IoT) represents the integration of several computing and communications systems aiming at facilitating the interaction between these devices. Arduino is one of the most popular platforms used to prototype new IoT devices due to its open, flexible and easy-to-use archi- tecture. Ardunio Yun is a dual board microcontroller that supports a Linux distribution and it is currently one of the most versatile and powerful Arduino systems. This feature positions Arduino Yun as a popular platform for developers, but it also introduces unique infection vectors from the secu- rity viewpoint. In this work, we present a security analysis of Arduino Yun. We show that Arduino Yun is vulnerable to a number of attacks and we implement a proof of concept capable of exploiting some of them.},

abstract = {Fuzzing is one of the most popular test-based software vulnerability detection techniques. It consists in running the target application with dedicated inputs in order to exhibit potential failures that could be exploited by a malicious user. In this paper we propose a global approach for fuzzing, addressing the main challenges to be faced in an industrial context: large- size applications, without source code access, and with a partial knowledge of the input specifications. This approach integrates several successive steps, and we mostly focus here on an important one which relies on binary-level dynamic taint analysis. We summarize the main problems to be addressed in this step, and we detail the solution we implemented to solve them.},

abstract = {We discuss the problem of path feasibility for programs manipulating strings using a collection of standard string library functions. We prove results on the complexity of this problem, including its undecidability in the general case and decidability of some special cases. In the context of test-case generation, we are interested in an efficient finite model finding method for string constraints. To this end we develop a two-tier finite model finding procedure. First, an integer abstraction of string constraints are passed to an SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solver. The abstraction is either unsatisfiable, or the solver produces a model that fixes lengths of enough strings to reduce the entire problem to be finite domain. The resulting fixed-length string constraints are then solved in a second phase. We implemented the procedure in a symbolic execution framework, report on the encouraging results and discuss directions for improving the method further.},

abstract = {The organizer of a machine learning competition faces the problem of maintaining an accurate leaderboard that faithfully represents the quality of the best submission of each competing team. What makes this estimation problem particularly challenging is its sequential and adaptive nature. As participants are allowed to repeatedly evaluate their submissions on the leaderboard, they may begin to overfit to the holdout data that supports the leaderboard. Few theoretical results give actionable advice on how to design a reliable leaderboard. Existing approaches therefore often resort to poorly understood heuristics such as limiting the bit precision of answers and the rate of re-submission. In this work, we introduce a notion of "leaderboard accuracy" tailored to the format of a competition. We introduce a natural algorithm called "the Ladder" and demonstrate that it simultaneously supports strong theoretical guarantees in a fully adaptive model of estimation, withstands practical adversarial attacks, and achieves high utility on real submission files from an actual competition hosted by Kaggle. Notably, we are able to sidestep a powerful recent hardness result for adaptive risk estimation that rules out algorithms such as ours under a seemingly very similar notion of accuracy. On a practical note, we provide a completely parameter-free variant of our algorithm that can be deployed in a real competition with no tuning required whatsoever.},

abstract = {Cache-timing attacks are a serious threat to security-critical software. We show that the combination of vector quantization and hidden Markov model cryptanalysis is a powerful tool for automated analysis of cache-timing data; it can be used to recover critical algorithm state such as key material. We demonstrate its effectiveness by running an attack on the elliptic curve portion of OpenSSL (0.9.8k and under). This involves automated lattice attacks leading to key recovery within hours. We carry out the attack on live cache-timing data without simulating the side channel, showing these attacks are practical and realistic.},

abstract = {For over two decades, timing attacks have been an active area of research within applied cryptography. These attacks exploit cryptosystem or protocol implementations that do not run in constant time. When implementing an elliptic curve cryptosystem with a goal to provide side-channel resistance, the scalar multiplication routine is a critical component. In such instances, one attractive method often suggested in the literature is Montgomery's ladder that performs a fixed sequence of curve and field operations. This paper describes a timing attack vulnerability in OpenSSL's ladder implementation for curves over binary fields. We use this vulnerability to steal the private key of a TLS server where the server authenticates with ECDSA signatures. Using the timing of the exchanged messages, the messages themselves, and the signatures, we mount a lattice attack that recovers the private key. Finally, we describe and implement an effective countermeasure.},

In particular we show that this idea of successive accepts and rejects applies to the multi-bandit best arm identification problem.},

@article{Bunge1993,
abstract = {How many kinds are there? Suppose that a population is partitioned into C classes. In many situations interest focuses not on estimation of the relative sizes of the classes, but on estimation of C itself. For example, biologists and ecologists may be interested in estimating the number of species in a population of plants or animals, numismatists may be concerned with estimating the number of dies used to produce an ancient coin issue, and linguists may be interested in estimating the size of an author's vocabulary. In this article we review the problem of statistical estimation of C. Many approaches have been proposed, some purely data-analytic and others based in sampling theory. In the latter case numerous variations have been considered. The population may be finite or infinite. If finite, samples may be taken with replacement (multinomial sampling) or without replacement (hypergeometric sampling), or by Bernoulli sampling; if infinite, sampling may be multinomial or Bernoulli, or the sample may be the result of random Poisson contributions of each class. Given a sampling model, one may approach estimation of C via a parametric or nonparametric formulation; in either case there may be frequentist and Bayesian procedures. We begin by discussing the existing literature on this problem (over 120 references), organizing it by sampling model, population specification, and philosophy of estimation. We find that (a) the problem is quite resistant to statistical solution, essentially because no matter how many classes have been observed, there may still be a large number of very small unobserved classes; (b) many closely related estimation procedures have been developed independently and have not yet been compared; (c) there is not as yet a globally preferable estimator of C, although for some models there is an acceptable estimator (for some not even this is true); and (d) there are promising directions for research to pursue; for example, it appears possible to exploit estimates of the ''coverage'' of the sample (the total proportion of the population represented by the observed classes) to improve the accuracy of estimators of the number of classes. Finally, we make specific recommendations for future research, regarding parametric estimation, coverage-based estimation, resampling methods, Poisson process representation of sampling models, and frequentist decision theory.},

abstract = {Memory corruption errors in C/C++ programs remain the most common source of security vulnerabilities in today's systems. Control-flow hijacking attacks exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities to divert program execution away from the intended control flow. Researchers have spent more than a decade studying and refining defenses based on Control-Flow Integrity (CFI), and this technique is now integrated into several production compilers. However, so far no study has systematically compared the various proposed CFI mechanisms, nor is there any protocol on how to compare such mechanisms. We compare a broad range of CFI mechanisms using a unified nomenclature based on (i) a qualitative discussion of the conceptual security guarantees, (ii) a quantitative security evaluation, and (iii) an empirical evaluation of their performance in the same test environment. For each mechanism, we evaluate (i) protected types of control-flow transfers, (ii) the precision of the protection for forward and backward edges. For open-source compiler-based implementations, we additionally evaluate (iii) the generated equivalence classes and target sets, and (iv) the runtime performance.},

This practice can lead to\nsoftware vulnerabilities when the embedded code is not kept up to date\nwith upstream sources. We propose an automated solution to identify\nclones of packages without any prior knowledge of these relationships.\nWe then correlate clones with vulnerability information to identify\noutstanding security problems. This approach motivates software\nmaintainers to avoid using cloned packages and link against system wide\nlibraries. We propose over 30 novel features that enable us to use to\nuse pattern classification to accurately identify package-level clones.\nTo our knowledge, we are the first to consider clone detection as a\nclassification problem. Our results show our system, Clonewise, compares\nwell to manually tracked databases. Based on our work, over 30 unknown\npackage clones and vulnerabilities have been identified and patched.},

abstract = {Binary code search has received much attention recently due to its impactful applications, e.g., plagiarism detection, malware detec-tion and software vulnerability auditing. However, developing an effective binary code search tool is challenging due to the gigantic syntax and structural differences in binaries resulted from different compilers, architectures and OSs. In this paper, we propose BINGO— a scalable and robust binary search engine supporting various ar-chitectures and OSs. The key contribution is a selective inlining technique to capture the complete function semantics by inlining relevant library and user-defined functions. In addition, architecture and OS neutral function filtering is proposed to dramatically reduce the irrelevant target functions. Besides, we introduce length variant partial traces to model binary functions in a program structure ag-nostic fashion. The experimental results show that BINGO can find semantic similar functions across architecture and OS boundaries, even with the presence of program structure distortion, in a scalable manner. Using BINGO, we also discovered a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe PDF Reader, a COTS binary.},

abstract = {In two-player finite-state stochastic games of partial observation on graphs, in every state of the graph, the players simultaneously choose an action, and their joint actions determine a probability distribution over the successor states. We consider reachability objectives where player 1 tries to ensure a target state to be visited almost-surely or positively. On the basis of information, the game can be one-sided with either (a)player 1 or (b)player 2 having partial observation, or two-sided with both players having partial observation. On the basis of randomization (a)players may not be allowed to use randomization (pure strategies), or (b)may choose a probability distribution over actions but the actual random choice is not visible (actions invisible), or (c)may use full randomization. Our results for pure strategies are as follows: (1)For one-sided games with player 2 perfect observation we show that belief-based strategies are not sufficient, and present an exponential upper bound on memory both for almost-sure and positive winning strategies; we show that the problem of deciding the existence of almost-sure and positive winning strategies for player 1 is EXPTIME-complete and present symbolic algorithms that avoid the explicit exponential construction. (2)For one-sided games with player 1 perfect observation we show that non-elementary memory is both necessary and sufficient for both almost-sure and positive winning strategies. (3)We show that for the two-sided case finite memory strategies are sufficient for both positive and almost-sure winning. We establish the equivalence of the almost-sure winning problem for pure strategies with randomized strategies with actions invisible. Our equivalence result exhibit serious flaws in previous results in the literature: we show a non-elementary memory lower bound for almost-sure winning whereas an exponential upper bound was claimed.},

abstract = {Modern automobiles are pervasively computerized, and hence potentially vulnerable to attack. However, while previous research has shown that the internal networks within some modern cars are insecure, the associated threat model requiring prior physical access has justifiably been viewed as unrealistic. Thus, it remains an open question if automobiles can also be susceptible to remote compromise. Our work seeks to put this question to rest by systematically analyzing the external attack surface of a modern automobile. We discover that remote exploitation is feasible via a broad range of attack vectors (including mechanics tools, CD players, Bluetooth and cellular radio), and further, that wireless communications channels allow long distance vehicle control, location tracking, in-cabin audio exfiltration and theft. Finally, we discuss the structural characteristics of the automotive ecosystem that give rise to such problems and highlight the practical challenges in mitigating them.},

They use Prolog rather than Datalog, and have some new stuff over MulVAL for adding preconditions and postconditions for vulnerabilities. This allows them to say, "this is vulnerable only under the case where the system runs out of space", an things of that type. Overall the paper is extremely vague. They don't really discuss the granularity of their system nor do they discuss any meaningful evaluation that is not based on runtime. They do have some nice comments on graceful degredation based on incomplete information. Like other papers, it looks like they feed in a full system specification as input.}},

abstract = {We perform static analysis of Java programs to answer a simple question: which values may occur as results of string expressions? The answers are summarized for each expression by a regular language that is guaranteed to contain all possible values. We present several applications of this analysis, including statically checking the syntax of dynamically generated expressions, such as SQL queries. Our analysis constructs flow graphs from class files and generates a context-free grammar with a nonterminal for each string expression. The language of this grammar is then widened into a regular language through a variant of an algorithm previously used for speech recognition. The collection of resulting regular languages is compactly represented as a special kind of multi-level automaton from which individual answers may be extracted. If a program error is detected, examples of invalid strings are automatically produced. We present extensive benchmarks demonstrating that the analysis is efficient and produces results of useful precision.},

abstract = { A malware detector is a system that attempts to determine whether a program has malicious intent. In order to evade detection, malware writers (hackers) frequently use obfuscation to morph malware. Malware detectors that use a pattern-matching approach (such as commercial virus scanners) are susceptible to obfuscations used by hackers. The fundamental deficiency in the pattern-matching approach to malware detection is that it is purely syntactic and ignores the semantics of instructions. In this paper, we present a malware-detection algorithm that addresses this deficiency by incorporating instruction semantics to detect malicious program traits. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our malware-detection algorithm can detect variants of malware with a relatively low run-time overhead. Moreover our semantics-aware malware detection algorithm is resilient to common obfuscations used by hackers.},

abstract = {The recently developed technique of arithmetic coding, in conjunction with a Markov model of the source, is a powerful method of data compression in situations where a linear treatment is inappropriate. Adaptive coding allows the model to be constructed dynamically by both encoder and decoder during the course of the transmission, and has been shown to incur a smaller coding overhead than explicit transmission of the model's statistics. But there is a basic conflict between the desire to use high-order Markov models and the need to have them formed quickly as the initial part of the message is sent. This paper describes how the conflict can be resolved with partial string matching, and reports experimental results which show that mixed-case English text can be coded in as little as 2.2 bits/ character with no prior knowledge of the source.

abstract = {To demonstrate and maintain academic integrity, some institutions require proctor supervision of online exams. However, proctoring can be very expensive. Costs to students can include fees at testing centers, costs to purchase the Remote Proctor, time to find an approved proctor, and effort required to coordinate a time for the exam. Costs to the institution include salaries of staff to administer a proctoring process, approval of proctors, maintaining testing centers, and potential loss of enrollments and revenue since not all institutions require proctors for online exams. This paper examines the control issues related to online exams and asserts that the total cost of proctors for online exams (time and money of both students and the institution) exceed potential benefits. The authors propose a less costly, non-proctor alternative to promote academic honesty, using eight control procedures that enable faculty to increase the difficulty and thus reduce the likelihood of cheating by students.},

@book{Cormen2001,
abstract = {This part will get you started in thinking about designing and analyzing algorithms. It is intended to be a gentle introduction to how we specify algorithms, some of the design strategies we will use throughout this book, and many of the fundamental ideas used in algorithm analysis. Later parts of this book will build upon this base. Chapter 1 is an overview of algorithms and their place in modern computing systems. This chapter defines what an algorithm is and lists some examples. It also makes a case that algorithms are a technology, just as are fast hardware, graphical user interfaces, object-oriented systems, and networks. In Chapter 2, we see our first algorithms, which solve the problem of sorting a sequence of n numbers. They are written in a pseudocode which, although not directly translatable to any conventional programming language, conveys the structure of the algorithm clearly enough that a competent programmer can implement it in the language of his choice. The sorting algorithms we examine are insertion sort, which uses an incremental approach, and merge sort, which uses a recursive technique known as divide and conquer. Although the time each requires increases with the value of n, the rate of increase differs between the two algorithms. We determine these running times in Chapter 2, and we develop a useful notation to express them. Chapter 3 precisely defines this notation, which we call asymptotic notation. It starts by defining several asymptotic notations, which we use for bounding algorithm running times from above and/or below. The rest of Chapter 3 is primarily a presentation of mathematical notation. Its purpose is more to ensure that your use of notation matches that in this book than to teach you new mathematical concepts.},

@inproceedings{Cova2010,
abstract = {JavaScript is a browser scripting language that allows developers to create sophisticated client-side interfaces for web applications. However, JavaScript code is also used to carry out attacks against the user's browser and its extensions. These attacks usually result in the download of additional malware that takes complete con- trol of the victim's platform, and are, therefore, called “drive-by downloads.” Unfortunately, the dynamic nature of the JavaScript language and its tight integration with the browser make it difficult to detect and block malicious JavaScript code. This paper presents a novel approach to the detection and analy- sis of malicious JavaScript code. Our approach combines anomaly detection with emulation to automatically identify malicious Java- Script code and to support its analysis. We developed a system that uses a number of features and machine-learning techniques to es- tablish the characteristics of normal JavaScript code. Then, during detection, the system is able to identify anomalous JavaScript code by emulating its behavior and comparing it to the established pro- files. In addition to identifying malicious code, the system is able to support the analysis of obfuscated code and to generate detection signatures for signature-based systems. The system has been made publicly available and has been used by thousands of analysts.},

@article{Dahse2014a,
abstract = {The World Wide Web grew rapidly during the last decades and is used by millions of people every day for online shopping, banking, networking, and other activities. Many of these websites are developed with PHP, the most popular scripting language on the Web. However, PHP code is prone to different types of critical security vulnerabilities that can lead to data leakage, server compromise, or attacks against an application's users. This problem can be addressed by analyzing the source code of the application for security vulnerabilities before the application is deployed on a web server. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the precise static analysis of PHP code to detect security vulnerabilities in web applications. As dismissed by previous work in this area, a comprehensive configuration and simulation of over 900 PHP built-in features allows us to precisely model the highly dynamic PHP language. By performing an intra- and inter-procedural data flow analysis and by creating block and function summaries, we are able to efficiently perform a backward-directed taint analysis for 20 different types of vulnerabilities. Furthermore, string analysis enables us to validate sanitization in a context-sensitive manner. Our method is the first to perform fine-grained analysis of the interaction between different types of sanitization, encoding, sources, sinks, markup contexts, and PHP settings. We implemented a prototype of our approach in a tool called RIPS. Our evaluation shows that RIPS is capable of finding severe vulnerabilities in popular real-world applications: we reported 73 previously unknown vulnerabilities in five well-known PHP applications such as phpBB, osCommerce, and the conference management software HotCRP.},

@article{Das2002,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a new algorithm for partial pro- gram verification that runs in polynomial time and space. We are interested in checking that a program satisfies a given temporal safety property. Our insight is that by accu- rately modeling only those branches in a program for which the property-related behavior differs along the arms of the branch, we can design an algorithm that is accurate enough to verify the program with respect to the given property, without paying the potentially exponential cost of full path- sensitive analysis. We have implemented this “property simulation” algo- rithm as part of a partial verification tool called ESP. We present the results of applying ESP to the problem of verify- ing the file I/O behavior of a version of the GNU C compiler (gcc, 140,000 LOC).We are able to prove that all of the 646 calls to fprintf in the source code of gcc are guaranteed to print to valid, open files. Our results show that property simulation scales to large programs and is accurate enough to verify meaningful properties.},

abstract = {We address the problem of code search in executables. Given a function in binary form and a large code base, our goal is to statically find similar functions in the code base. Towards this end, we present a novel technique for computing similarity between functions. Our notion of similarity is based on decomposition of functions into tracelets: continuous, short, partial traces of an execution. To establish tracelet similarity in the face of low-level compiler transformations, we employ a simple rewriting engine. This engine uses constraint solving over alignment constraints and data dependencies to match registers and memory addresses between tracelets, bridging the gap between tracelets that are otherwise similar. We have implemented our approach and applied it to find matches in over a million binary functions. We compare tracelet matching to approaches based on n-grams and graphlets and show that tracelet matching obtains dramatically better precision and recall.},

abstract = {When the running time of a cryptographic algorithm is nonconstant, timing measurements can leak informations about the secret key. This idea, rst publicly introduced by Kocher, is developed here to attack an earlier version of the CASCADE smart cardy. We propose several improvements on Kocher's ideas, leading to a practical implementation that is able to break a 512-bit key in a few minutes, provided we are able to collect 300000 timing measurements (128-bit keys can be recovered in a few seconds using a personal computer and less than 10000 samples). We therefore show that the timing attack represents an important threat against cryptosystems, whichmust be very seriously taken into account.},

Most SEED labs use Ubuntu Linux. A few labs require significant effort for kernel-level coding; for them, the author chose Minix, an instructional OS. SEED labs don't require a dedi cated physical laboratory. The author created a prebuilt VM image of Ubuntu and installed the necessary software. Various lab environment setups were tried, including using students' PCs, a general computing lab, and a cloud-computing infrastructure. And found that for convenience, students prefer to use their own computers.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that automated, architecture-independent gadget search is possible. Gadgets are code fragments which can be used to build unintended programs from existing code in memory. Our contribution is a framework of algorithms capable of locating a Turing-complete gadget set. Translat- ing machine code into an intermediate language allows our framework to be used for many different CPU architectures with minimal architecture-dependent adjustments. We define the paradigm of free-branch instructions to succinctly cap- ture which gadgets will be found by our framework and inves- tigate side effects of the gadgets produced. Furthermore we discuss architectural idiosyncrasies for several widely spread CPU architectures and how they need to be taken into account by the generic algorithms when locating gadgets.},

@inproceedings{Eschweiler2016,
abstract = {—The identification of security-critical vulnerabilities is a key for protecting computer systems. Being able to perform this process at the binary level is very important given that many software projects are closed-source. Even if the source code is available, compilation may create a mismatch between the source code and the binary code that is executed by the processor, causing analyses that are performed on source code to fail at detecting certain bugs and thus potential vulnerabilities. Existing approaches to find bugs in binary code 1) use dynamic analysis, which is difficult for firmware; 2) handle only a single architecture; or 3) use semantic similarity, which is very slow when analyzing large code bases. In this paper, we present a new approach to efficiently search for similar functions in binary code. We use this method to identify known bugs in binaries as follows: starting with a vulnerable binary function, we identify similar functions in other binaries across different compilers, optimization levels, operating systems, and CPU architectures. The main idea is to compute similarity between functions based on the structure of the corresponding control flow graphs. To minimize this costly computation, we employ an efficient pre-filter based on numeric features to quickly identify a small set of candidate functions. This allows us to efficiently search for similar functions in large code bases. We have designed and implemented a prototype of our approach, called discovRE, that supports four instruction set architectures (x86, x64, ARM, MIPS). We show that discovRE is four orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art academic approach for cross-architecture bug search in binaries. We also show that we can identify Heartbleed and POODLE vulnerabilities in an Android system image that contains over 130,000 native ARM functions in about 80 milliseconds.},

@inproceedings{Feng2016,
abstract = {Because of rampant security breaches in IoT devices, searching vulnerabilities in massive IoT ecosystems is more crucial than ever. Recent studies have demonstrated that control-flow graph (CFG) based bug search techniques can be effective and accurate in IoT devices across different architectures. However, these CFG-based bug search approaches are far from being scalable to handle an enormous amount of IoT devices in the wild, due to their expen-sive graph matching overhead. Inspired by rich experience in im-age and video search, we propose a new bug search scheme which addresses the scalability challenge in existing cross-platform bug search techniques and further improves search accuracy. Unlike existing techniques that directly conduct searches based upon raw features (CFGs) from the binary code, we convert the CFGs into high-level numeric feature vectors. Compared with the CFG fea-ture, high-level numeric feature vectors are more robust to code variation across different architectures, and can easily achieve real-time search by using state-of-the-art hashing techniques. We have implemented a bug search engine, Genius, and com-pared it with state-of-art bug search approaches. Experimental re-sults show that Genius outperforms baseline approaches for vari-ous query loads in terms of speed and accuracy. We also evaluated Genius on a real-world dataset of 33,045 devices which was col-lected from public sources and our system. The experiment showed that Genius can finish a search within 1 second on average when performed over 8,126 firmware images of 420,558,702 functions. By only looking at the top 50 candidates in the search result, we found 38 potentially vulnerable firmware images across 5 vendors, and confirmed 23 of them by our manual analysis. We also found that it took only 0.1 seconds on average to finish searching for all 154 vulnerabilities in two latest commercial firmware images from D-LINK. 103 of them are potentially vulnerable in these images, and 16 of them were confirmed.},

Before any optimizing routine can be invoked, considerable e{\textregistered}ort must be expended to formulate the underlying model and to generate the requisite computational data structures. AMPL is a new language designed to make these steps easier and less error-prone. AMPL closely resembles the symbolic algebraic notation that many modelers use to describe mathematical programs, yet it is regular and formal enough to be processed by a computer system; it is particularly notable for the generality of its syntax and for the variety of its indexing operations. We have implemented a translator that takes as input a linear AMPL model and associated data, and produces output suitable for standard linear programming optimizers. Both the language and the translator admit straightforward extensions to more general mathematical programs that incorporate nonlinear expressions or discrete variables.},

abstract = {Motivated by recent applications of dominator computations, we consider the problem of dynamically maintaining the dominators of flow graphs through a sequence of insertions and deletions of edges. Our main theoretical contribution is a simple incremental algorithm that maintains the dominator tree of a flow graph with $n$ vertices through a sequence of $k$ edge insertions in $O(m\min\{n,k\}+kn)$ time, where $m$ is the total number of edges after all insertions. Moreover, we can test in constant time if a vertex $u$ dominates a vertex $v$, for any pair of query vertices $u$ and $v$. Next, we present a new decremental algorithm to update a dominator tree through a sequence of edge deletions. Although our new decremental algorithm is not asymptotically faster than repeated applications of a static algorithm, i.e., it runs in $O(mk)$ time for $k$ edge deletions, it performs well in practice. By combining our new incremental and decremental algorithms we obtain a fully dynamic algorithm that maintains the dominator tree through intermixed sequence of insertions and deletions of edges. Finally, we present efficient implementations of our new algorithms as well as of existing algorithms, and conduct an extensive experimental study on real-world graphs taken from a variety of application areas.},

This tool uses a numeric-string hybrid symbolic execution engine at its core which is based on the Symbolic Java PathFinder platform. However, in order to make the tool applicable to industrial applications the existing generic platform had to be enhanced in numerous ways that we describe in this paper. The JST tool consists of newly supported essential Java library components and widely used data structures; novel solving techniques for string constraints, regular expressions, and their interactions with integer and floating point numbers; and key optimizations that make the tool more efficient. We present a methodology to seamlessly integrate the features mentioned above to make the tool scalable to industrial applications that are beyond the reach of the original platform in terms of both applicability and performance. We also present extensive experimental data to illustrate the effectiveness of our tool.},

abstract = {Whitebox fuzzing extends dynamic test generation based on sym- bolic execution and constraint solving from unit testing to whole- application security testing. Unfortunately, input-dependent loops may cause an explosion in the number of constraints to be solved and in the number of execution paths to be explored. In practice, whitebox fuzzers arbitrarily bound the number of constraints and paths due to input-dependent loops, at the risk of missing code and bugs. In thiswork, we investigate the use of simple loop-guard pattern- matching rules to automatically guess an input constraint defining the number of iterations of input-dependent loops during dynamic symbolic execution. We discover the loop structure of the program on the fly, detect induction variables, which are variables modified by a constant value during loop iterations, and infer simple partial loop invariants relating the value of such variables. Whenever a guess is confirmed later during the current dynamic symbolic ex- ecution, we then inject new constraints representing pre and post loop conditions, effectively summarizing sets of executions of that loop. These pre and post conditions are derived from partial loop invariants synthesized dynamically using pattern-matching rules on the loop guards and induction variables,without requiring any static analysis, theoremproving, or input-format specification. This tech- nique has been implemented in the whitebox fuzzer SAGE, scales to large programs with many nested loops, and we present results of experiments with aWindows 7 image parser},

A runtime Virtual Machine (VM) customized for testing purposes then starts executing the code at that location, catches all memory operations before they occur, allocates memory on-the-fly in order to perform those read/write memory operations, and provides input values according to a customizable memory policy, which defines what read memory accesses should be treated as inputs. MicroX is a first prototype VM allowing micro execution of x86 binary code. No test driver, no input data, no source code, no debug symbols are required: MicroX automatically discovers dynamically the Input/Output interface of the code being run. Input values are provided as needed along the execution and can be generated in various ways, e.g., randomly or using some other test-generation tool.

abstract = {Web-based timing attacks have been known for over a decade, and it has been shown that, under optimal network condi-tions, an adversary can use such an attack to obtain infor-mation on the state of a user in a cross-origin website. In recent years, desktop computers have given way to laptops and mobile devices, which are mostly connected over a wire-less or mobile network. These connections often do not meet the optimal conditions that are required to reliably perform cross-site timing attacks. In this paper, we show that modern browsers expose new side-channels that can be used to acquire accurate timing measurements, regardless of network conditions. Using sev-eral real-world examples, we introduce four novel web-based timing attacks against modern browsers and describe how an attacker can use them to obtain personal information based on a user's state on a cross-origin website. We evalu-ate our proposed attacks and demonstrate that they signif-icantly outperform current attacks in terms of speed, relia-bility, and accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the nature of our attacks renders traditional defenses, i.e., those based on randomly delaying responses, moot and discuss possible server-side defense mechanisms.},

abstract = {As existing defenses like ASLR, DEP, and stack cookies are not sufficient to stop determined attackers from exploiting our software, interest in Control Flow Integrity (CFI) is growing. In its ideal form, CFI prevents flows of control that were not intended by the original program, effectively putting a stop to exploitation based on return oriented programming (and many other attacks besides). Two main problems have prevented CFI from being deployed in practice. First, many CFI implementations require source code or debug information that is typically not available for commercial software. Second, in its ideal form, the technique is very expensive. It is for this reason that current research efforts focus on making CFI fast and practical. Specifically, much of the work on practical CFI is applicable to binaries, and improves performance by enforcing a looser notion of control flow integrity. In this paper, we examine the security implications of such looser notions of CFI: are they still able to prevent code reuse attacks, and if not, how hard is it to bypass its protection? Specifically, we show that with two new types of gadgets, return oriented programming is still possible. We assess the availability of our gadget sets, and demonstrate the practicality of these results with a practical exploit against Internet Explorer that bypasses modern CFI implementatio},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to bug-finding analysis and an implementation of that approach. Our goal is to find as many serious bugs as possible. To do so, we designed a flexible, easy-to-use extension language for specifying analyses and an efficent algorithm for executing these extensions. The language, metal , allows the users of our system to specify a broad class of analyses in terms that resemble the intuitive description of the rules that they check. The system, xgcc , executes these analyses efficiently using a context-sensitive, interprocedural analysis. Our prior work has shown that the approach described in this paper is effective: it has successfully found thousands of bugs in real systems code. This paper describes the underlying system used to achieve these results. We believe that our system is an effective framework for deploying new bug-finding analyses quickly and easily.},

abstract = {Mobile application markets such as the Android Marketplace provide a centralized showcase of applications that end users can purchase or download for free onto their mobile phones. Despite the influx of applications to the markets, applications are cursorily reviewed by marketplace maintainers due to the vast number of submissions. User policing and reporting is the primary method to detect misbehaving applications. This reactive approach to application security, especially when programs can contain bugs, malware, or pirated (inauthentic) code, puts too much responsibility on the end users. In light of this, we propose Juxtapp, a scalable infrastructure for code similarity analysis among Android applications. Juxtapp provides a key solution to a number of problems in Android security, including determining if apps contain copies of buggy code, have significant code reuse that indicates piracy, or are instances of known malware. We evaluate our system using more than 58,000 Android applications and demonstrate that our system scales well and is effective. Our results show that Juxtapp is able to detect: 1) 463 applications with confirmed buggy code reuse that can lead to serious vulnerabilities in real-world apps, 2) 34 instances of known malware and variants (13 distinct variants of the GoldDream malware), and 3) pirated variants of a popular paid game.},

The high levels of cheating among students have come about largely because of permissive seating arrangements in overcrowded rooms, and the use of a single exam paper. Software programs have been developed which can identify cheats. One operates by flagging those individuals with errors in common. The other assesses the number of correct answers against the number of differences in the exam paper for a suspect pair. The accumulated evidence indicates that significant amounts of extreme cheating and partial copying are going on. Both types of cheating can be positively identified. Despite their intrusive nature, simple measures such as seat and examination scrambling are recommended in order to eliminate the problem of cheating in multiple-choice examinations.},

@article{Harris2010,
abstract = {Path-sensitivity is often a crucial requirement for verifying safety properties of programs. As it is infeasible to enumerate and ana- lyze each path individually, analyses compromise by soundlymerg- ing information about executions along multiple paths. However, this frequently results in a loss of precision. We present a program analysis technique that we call SatisfiabilityModulo Path Programs (SMPP), based on a path-based decomposition of a program. It is inspired by insights that have driven the development of modern SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theory) solvers. SMPP symbolically enumerates path programs using a SAT formula over control edges in the program. Each enumerated path program is verified using an oracle, such as abstract interpretation or symbolic execution, to ei- ther find a proof of correctness or report a potential violation. If a proof is found, then SMPP extracts a sufficient set of control edges and corresponding interference edges, as a form of proof-based learning. Blocking clauses derived fromthese edges are added back to the SAT formula to avoid enumeration of other path programs guaranteed to be correct, thereby improving performance and scal- ability. We have applied SMPP in the F-Soft program verification framework, to verify properties of real-world C programs that re- quire path-sensitive reasoning. Our results indicate that the preci- sion fromanalyzing individual path programs, combined with their efficient enumeration by SMPP, can prove properties as well as in- dicate potential violations in the large.},

abstract = {The x86-64 ISA sits at the bottom of the software stack of most desktop and server software. Because of its importance, many software analysis and verification tools depend, either explicitly or implicitly, on correct modeling of the semantics of x86-64 instructions. However, formal semantics for the x86-64 ISA are difficult to obtain and often written manually through great effort. We describe an automatically synthesized formal semantics of the input/output behavior for a large fraction of the x86-64 Haswell ISA's many thousands of instruction variants. The key to our results is stratified synthesis, where we use a set of instructions whose semantics are known to synthesize the semantics of additional instructions whose semantics are unknown. As the set of formally described instructions increases, the synthesis vocabulary expands, making it possible to synthesize the semantics of increasingly complex instructions. Using this technique we automatically synthesized formal semantics for 1,795 instruction variants of the x86-64 Haswell ISA. We evaluate the learned semantics against manually written semantics (where available) and find that they are formally equivalent with the exception of 50 instructions, where the manually written semantics contain an error. We further find the learned formulas to be largely as precise as manually written ones and of similar size.},

abstract = {We study the problem of exploration in stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits. Even in the simplest setting of identifying the best arm, there remains a logarithmic multiplica- tive gap between the known lower and upper bounds for the number of arm pulls required for the task. This extra logarithmic factor is quite meaningful in nowadays large-scale ap- plications. We present two novel, parameter- free algorithms for identifying the best arm, in two different settings: given a target con- fidence and given a target budget of arm pulls, for which we prove upper bounds whose gap from the lower bound is only doubly- logarithmic in the problem parameters. We corroborate our theoretical results with ex- periments demonstrating that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art and scales better as the size of the problem increases.},

abstract = {Reasoning about string variables, in particular program inputs, is an important aspect of many program analyses and testing frameworks. Program inputs invariably arrive as strings, and are often manipulated using high-level string operations such as equality checks, regular expression matching, and string concatenation. It is difficult to reason about these operations because they are not well-integrated into current constraint solvers. We present a decision procedure that solves systems of equations over regular language variables. Given such a system of constraints, our algorithm finds satisfying assignments for the variables in the system. We define this problem formally and render a mechanized correctness proof of the core of the algorithm. We evaluate its scalability and practical utility by applying it to the problem of automatically finding inputs that cause SQL injection vulnerabilities.},

abstract = {Web applications often use special string-manipulating sanitizers on untrusted user data, but it is difficult to reason manually about the behavior of these functions, leading to errors. For example, the Internet Explorer cross-site scripting filter turned out to transform some web pages without JavaScript into web pages with valid Java-Script, enabling attacks. In other cases, sanitizers may fail to commute, rendering one order of application safe and the other dangerous. BEK is a language and system for writing sanitizers that enables precise analysis of sanitizer behavior, including checking idempotence, commutativity, and equivalence. For example, BEK can determine if a target string, such as an entry on the XSS Cheat Sheet, is a valid output of a sanitizer. If so, our analysis synthesizes an input string that yields that target. Our language is expressive enough to capture real web sanitizers used in ASP.NET, the Internet Explorer XSS Filter, and the Google AutoEscape framework, which we demonstrate by porting these sanitizers to BEK. Our analyses use a novel symbolic finite automata representation to leverage fast satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers and are quick in practice, taking fewer than two seconds to check the commutativity of the entire set of Internet Exporer XSS filters, between 36 and 39 seconds to check implementations of HTMLEncode against target strings from the XSS Cheat Sheet, and less than ten seconds to check equivalence between all pairs of a set of implementations of HTMLEncode. Programs written in BEK can be compiled to traditional languages such as JavaScript and C#, making it possible for web developers to write sanitizers supported by deep analysis, yet deploy the analyzed code directly to real applications.},

Recent work on string analysis has focused on providing decision procedures that model string operations. Separating string analysis from its client applications has important and familiar benefits: it enables the independent improvement of string analysis tools and it saves client effort. We present a constraint solving algorithm for equations over string variables. We focus on scalability with regard to the size of the input constraints. Our algorithm performs an explicit search for a satisfying assignment; the search space is constructed lazily based on an automata representation of the constraints. We evaluate our approach by comparing its performance with that of existing string decision procedures. Our prototype is, on average, several orders of magnitude faster than the fastest existing implementation},

abstract = {As control-flow hijacking defenses gain adoption, it is important to understand the remaining capabilities of adversaries via memory exploits. Non-control data exploits are used to mount information leakage attacks or privilege escalation attacks program memory. Compared to control-flow hijacking attacks, such non-control data exploits have limited expressiveness, however, the question is: what is the real expressive power of non-control data attacks? In this paper we show that such attacks are Turing-complete. We present a systematic technique called data-oriented programming (DOP) to construct expressive non-control data exploits for arbitrary x86 programs. In the experimental evaluation using 9 programs, we identified 7518 data-oriented x86 gadgets and 5052 gadget dispatchers, which are the building blocks for DOP. 8 out of 9 real-world programs have gadgets to simulate arbitrary computations and 2 of them are confirmed to be able to build Turing-complete attacks. We build 3 end-to-end attacks to bypass randomization defenses without leaking addresses, to run a network bot which takes commands from the attacker, and to alter the memory permissions. All the attacks work in the presence of ASLR and DEP, demonstrating how the expressiveness offered by DOP significantly empowers the attacker.},

Sometimes, phylogenetic networks are used as a means of representing reticulate evolution or of showing uncertainty and incompatibilities in evolutionary datasets. This is often done using unrooted phylogenetic networks such as split networks, due in part, to the availability of software (SplitsTree) for their computation and visualization. In this paper we discuss the problem of drawing rooted phylogenetic networks as cladograms or phylograms in a number of different views that are commonly used for rooted trees. Implementations of the algorithms are available in new releases of the Dendroscope and SplitsTree programs.},

Although it is generally undisputed that bifurcating speciation events and descent with modifications are major forces of evolution, there is a growing belief that reticulate events also have a role to play. Phylogenetic networks provide an alternative to phylogenetic trees and may be more suitable for data sets where evolution involves significant amounts of reticulate events, such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer, or recombination. In this article, we give an introduction to the topic of phylogenetic networks, very briefly describing the fundamental concepts and summarizing some of the most important combinatorial methods that are available for their computation.},

abstract = {Perhaps surprisingly, it is possible to predict how long an algorithm will take to run on a previously unseen input, using machine learning techniques to build a model of the algorithm's runtime as a function of problem-specific instance features. Such models have important applications to algorithm analysis, portfolio-based algorithm selection, and the automatic configuration of parameterized algorithms. Over the past decade, a wide variety of techniques have been studied for building such models. Here, we describe extensions and improvements of existing models, new families of models, and - perhaps most importantly - a much more thorough treatment of algorithm parameters as model inputs. We also comprehensively describe new and existing features for predicting algorithm runtime for propositional satisfiability (SAT), travelling salesperson (TSP) and mixed integer programming (MIP) problems. We evaluate these innovations through the largest empirical analysis of its kind, comparing to a wide range of runtime modelling techniques from the literature. Our experiments consider 11 algorithms and 35 instance distributions; they also span a very wide range of SAT, MIP, and TSP instances, with the least structured having been generated uniformly at random and the most structured having emerged from real industrial applications. Overall, we demonstrate that our new models yield substantially better runtime predictions than previous approaches in terms of their generalization to new problem instances, to new algorithms from a parameterized space, and to both simultaneously. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Igarashi2001,
abstract = {Several recent studies have introduced lightweight versions of Java: reduced languages in which complex features like threads and reflection are dropped to enable rigorous arguments about key properties such as type safety. We carry this process a step further, omitting almost all features of the full language (including interfaces and even assignment) to obtain a small calculus, Featherweight Java, for which rigorous proofs are not only possible but easy. Featherweight Java bears a similar relation to Java as the lambda-calculus does to languages such as ML and Haskell. It offers a similar computational "feel," providing classes, methods, fields, inheritance, and dynamic typecasts with a semantics closely following Java's. A proof of type safety for Featherweight Java thus illustrates many of the interesting features of a safety proof for the full language, while remaining pleasingly compact. The minimal syntax, typing rules, and operational semantics of Featherweight Java make it a handy tool for studying the consequences of extensions and variations. As an illustration of its utility in this regard, we extend Featherweight Java with generic classes in the style of GJ (Bracha, Odersky, Stoutamire, and Wadler) and give a detailed proof of type safety. The extended system formalizes for the first time some of the key features of GJ.},

However, onthe other hand, it causes some negative consequences such asbloatware and feature creep which have been observed in manysoftware evolution and iteration lifecycle. In this paper, we proposean approach to customizing Java bytecode by applying staticdataflow analysis and enhanced programming slicing technique. This approach allows developers to customize Java programsbased on various users' requirements or remove unnecessaryfeatures from tangled code in legacy projects. We evaluate ourapproach by conducting case studies on removing cross cuttingfeatures from real world Java programs. The results show thatour approach has the potential for practical use. Additionally, we find out that, by increasing the diversity of the software, ourapproach can help achieve moving target defense.},

abstract = {Simple, polynomial-time, heuristic algorithms for finding approximate solutions to various polynomial complete optimization problems are analyzed with respect to their worst case behavior, measured by the ratio of the worst solution value that can be chosen by the algorithm to the optimal value. For certain problems, such as a simple form of the knapsack problem and an optimization problem based on satisfiability testing, there are algorithms for which this ratio is bounded by a constant, independent of the problem size. For a number of set covering problems, simple algorithms yield worst case ratios which can grow with the log of the problem size. And for the problem of finding the maximum clique in a graph, no algorithm has been found for which the ratio does not grow at least as fast as 0(n&egr;), where n is the problem size and &egr;> 0 depends on the algorithm.},

abstract = {The number and the importance of web applications have increased rapidly over the last years. At the same time, the quantity and impact of security vulnerabilities in such applications have grown as well. Since manual code reviews are time-consuming, error-prone and costly, the need for automated solutions has become evident. In this paper, we address the problem of vulnerable web applications by means of static source code analysis. More precisely, we use flow-sensitive, interprocedural and context-sensitive data flow analysis to discover vulnerable points in a program. In addition to the taint analysis at the core of our engine, we employ a precise alias analysis targeted at the unique reference semantics commonly found in scripting languages. Moreover, we enhance the quality and quantity of the generated vulnerability reports by em- ploying an iterative two-phase algorithm for fast and precise resolution of file inclusions. The presented concepts are targeted at the general class of taint-style vulnerabilities and can be easily applied to the de- tection of vulnerability types such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection. We implemented the presented concepts in Pixy, a high-precision static analysis tool aimed at detecting cross-site scripting and SQL injection vulnerabilities in PHP programs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques, we analyzed a number of popular, open-source web applications and discovered hun- dreds of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Both the high analysis speed as well as the low number of generated false positives show that our techniques can be used for conducting effective security audits.},

abstract = {Code cloning is not only assumed to inflate maintenance costs but also considered defect-prone as inconsistent changes to code duplicates can lead to unexpected behavior. Consequently, the identification of duplicated code, clone detection, has been a very active area of research in recent years. Up to now, however, no substantial investigation of the consequences of code cloning on program correctness has been carried out. To remedy this shortcoming, this paper presents the results of a large-scale case study that was undertaken to find out if inconsistent changes to cloned code can indicate faults. For the analyzed commercial and open source systems we not only found that inconsistent changes to clones are very frequent but also identified a significant number of faults induced by such changes. The clone detection tool used in the case study implements a novel algorithm for the detection of inconsistent clones. It is available as open source to enable other researchers to use it as basis for further investigations.},

abstract = {Locating, extracting, and reusing the implementation of a feature within an existing binary program is challenging. This paper proposes a novel algorithm to identify modular functions corresponding to such features and to provide usable interfaces for the extracted functions. We provide a way to represent a desired feature with two executions that both execute the feature but with different inputs. Instead of reverse engineering the interface of a function, we wrap the existing interface and provide a simpler and more intuitive interface for the function through concretization and redirection. Experiments show that our technique can be applied to extract varied features from several real world applications including a malicious application.},

abstract = {Execution comparison has many applications in debugging, malware analysis, software feature identification, and intrusion detection. Existing comparison techniques have various limitations. Some can only compare at the system event level and require executions to take the same input. Some require storing instruction traces that are very space-consuming and have difficulty dealing with non-determinism. In this paper, we propose a novel dual execution technique that allows on-the-fly comparison at the instruction level. Only differences between the executions are recorded. It allows executions to proceed in a coupled mode such that they share the same input sequence with the same timing, reducing nondeterminism. It also allows them to proceed in a decoupled mode such that the user can interact with each one differently. Decoupled executions can be recoupled to share the same future inputs and facilitate further comparison. We have implemented a prototype and applied it to identifying functional components for reuse, comparative debugging with new GDB primitives, and understanding real world regression failures. Our results show that dual execution is a critical enabling technique for execution comparison.},

abstract = {Static disassembly is a crucial first step in reverse engineering executable files, and there is a considerable body of work in reverse-engineering of binaries, as well as areas such as semantics-based security analysis, that assumes that the input executable has been correctly disassembled. However, disassembly errors, e.g., arising from binary obfuscations, can render this assumption invalid. This work describes a machine-learning-based approach, using decision trees, for statically identifying possible errors in a static disassembly; such potential errors may then be examined more closely, e.g., using dynamic analyses. Experimental results using a variety of input executables indicate that our approach performs well, correctly identifying most disassembly errors with relatively few false positives.},

abstract = {Since its introduction prediction by partial matching (PPM) has always been a de facto gold standard in lossless text compression, where many variants improving the compression ratio and speed have been proposed. However, reducing the high space requirement of PPM schemes did not gain that much attention. This study focuses on reducing the memory consumption of PPM via the recently proposed compressed context modeling that uses the compressed representations of contexts in the statistical model. Differently from the classical context definition as the string of the preceding characters at a particular position, CCM considers context as the amount of preceding information that is actually the bit stream composed by compressing the previous symbols. We observe that by using the CCM, the data structures, particularly the context trees, can be implemented in smaller space, and present a trade-off between the compression ratio and the space requirement. The experiments conducted showed that this trade-off is especially beneficial in low orders with approximately 20 - 25 percent gain in memory by a sacrifice of up to nearly 7 percent loss in compression ratio.},

@article{Lam2005a,
abstract = {Program analysis has been increasingly used in software engineering tasks such as auditing programs for security vulnerabilities and finding errors in general. Such tools often require analyses much more sophisticated than those traditionally used in compiler optimizations. In particular, context-sensitive pointer alias information is a prerequisite for any sound and precise analysis that reasons about uses of heap objects in a program. Context-sensitive analysis is challenging because there are over 1014 contexts in a typical large program, even after recursive cycles are collapsed. Moreover, pointers cannot be resolved in general without analyzing the entire program. This paper presents a new framework, based on the concept of deductive databases, for context-sensitive program analysis. In this framework, all program information is stored as relations; data access and analyses are written as Datalog queries. To handle the large number of contexts in a program, the database represents relations with binary decision diagrams (BDDs). The system we have developed, called bddbddb, automatically translates database queries into highly optimized BDD programs. Our preliminary experiences suggest that a large class of analyses involving heap objects can be described succinctly in Datalog and implemented efficiently with BDDs. To make developing application-specific analyses easy for programmers, we have also created a language called PQL that makes a subset of Datalog queries more intuitive to define. We have used the language to find many security holes in Web applications.},

abstract = {—Code reuse attacks have become one of the most popular exploitation techniques, and coarse-grained control flow integrity (CFI) is a practical approach used to prevent such attacks. Recently, some new approaches have been proposed to construct call-preceded-ROP attacks to bypass coarse-grained CFI, however, we find that they still fail to bypass shadow stack, which enforces caller-callee semantics to strengthen CFI that constrains the control flow in a much stricter way. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new code reuse attack, named loop-oriented programming (LOP), aiming to bypass both coarse-grained CFI and shadow stack. Quite different from previous code reuse attacks, LOP collects entire functions as basic building blocks (i.e., gadgets), and chains these gadgets in a way that the control flows strictly follow the process of call-ret-pairing. Specifically, LOP selects a particular function with a loop statement, called loop gadget, to chain all the available gadgets. To demonstrate the effectiveness of LOP, we construct a proof-of-concept exploit against Internet Explorer 8 on 32-bit x86 platform.},

abstract = {We would all benefit if software were slimmer, thinner, and generally only did what we needed and nothing more. To this end, our research team has been exploring methods for removing unused and undesirable features from compiled programs. Our primary goal is to improve software security by removing rarely used features in order to decrease a pro- gram's attack surface. We describe two different approaches for "thinning" binary images of compiled programs. The first approach removes specific program features using dynamic tracing as a guide. This approach is safer than many alterna- tives, but is limited to removing code which is reachable in a trace when an undesirable feature is enabled. The second ap- proach uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to mutate a program until a suitable variant is found. Our GA-based approach can potentially remove any code that is not strictly required for proper execution, but may break program semantics in unpredictable ways. We show results of these approaches on a simple program and real-world software and explore some of the implications for software security.},

abstract = {Improperly bounded program inputs present a major class of program defects. In secure applications, these bugs can be exploited by malicious users, allowing them to overwrite buffers and execute harmful code. In this paper, we present a high coverage dynamic technique for detecting software faults caused by improperly bounded program inputs. Our approach is novel in that it retains the advantages of dynamic bug detection, scope and precision; while at the same time, relaxing the requirement that the user specify the input that exposes the bug. To implement our approach, inputs are shadowed by additional state that characterize the allowed bounds of input-derived variables. Program operations and decision points may alter the shadowed state associated with input variables. Potentially hazardous program sites, such as an array references and string functions, are checked against the entire range of values that the user might specify. The approach found several bugs including two high-risk security bugs in a recent version of OpenSSH.},

Data Structure Analysis\nattempts to identify disjoint instances of logical program data structures\nand their internal and external connectivity properties. Data Structure\nAnalysis is fully context-sensitive (in the sense that it names memory\nobjects by entire acyclic call paths), is fieldsensitive, builds\nan explicit model of the heap, and is robust enough to handle the\nfull generality of C. Despite these aggressive features, the algorithm\nis both extremely fast (requiring 2-7 seconds for C programs in the\nrange of 100K lines of code) and is scalable in practice. It has\nthree features we believe are novel: (a) it incrementally builds\na precise program call graph during the analysis; (b) it distinguishes\ncomplete and incomplete information in a manner that simplifies analysis\nof libraries or other portions of programs; and (c) it uses speculative\nfield-senstivity in typeunsafe programs in order to preserve efficiency\nand scalability. Finally, it shows that the key to achieving scalability\nin a fully context-sensitive algorithm is the use of a unificationbased\napproach, a combination that has been used before but whose importance\nhas not been clearly articulated.},

abstract = {Binary instrumentation facilitates the insertion of additional code into an executable in order to observe or modify the executable's behavior. There are two main approaches to binary instrumentation: static and dynamic binary instrumentation. In this paper we present a static binary instrumentation toolkit for Linux on the x86/x86_64 platforms, PEBIL (PMaC's Efficient Binary Instrumentation Toolkit for Linux). PEBIL is similar to other toolkits in terms of how additional code is inserted into the executable. However, it is designed with the primary goal of producing efficient-running instrumented code. To this end, PEBIL uses function level code relocation in order to insert large but fast control structures. Furthermore, the PEBIL API provides tool developers with the means to insert lightweight hand-coded assembly rather than relying solely on the insertion of instrumentation functions. These features enable the implementation of efficient instrumentation tools with PEBIL. The overhead introduced for basic block counting by PEBIL is an average of 65% of the overhead of Dyninst, 41% of the overhead of Pin, 15% of the overhead of DynamoRIO, and 8% of the overhead of Valgrind.},

abstract = {Full-system emulation on FPGA(Field-Programmable Gate Array) with real-world workloads can enhance the confidence of SoC(System-on-Chip) design. However, since FPGA emulation requires complete implementation of key modules and provides weak visibility, it is time-consuming. This paper proposes FEMU, a hybrid firmware/hardware emulation framework for SoC verification. The core of FEMU is implemented by transplanting QEMU, a full-system emulator, from OS level to BIOS level, so we can directly emulate devices upon hardware. Moreover, FEMU provides programming interfaces to simplify device modeling in firmware. Based on an auxiliary set of hardware modules, FEMU allows hybrid full-system emulation with the combination of real hardware and emulated firmware model. Therefore, FEMU can facilitate full-system emulation in three aspects. First, FEMU enables full-system emulation with the minimum hardware implementation, so the DUT (Design Under Test) module can be verified under target application as early as possible. Second, by comparing the execution traces generated using real hardware and emulated firmware model, respectively, FEMU helps locate and fix bugs occurred in the full-system emulation. Third, by replacing un-verified hardware modules with emulated firmware models, FEMU helps isolating design issues in multiple modules. In a practical SoC project, FEMU helped us identify several design issues in full-system emulation. In addition, the evaluation results show that the emulation speed of FEMU is comparable with QEMU after transplantation.},

abstract = {HPCTOOLKIT is an integrated suite of tools that supports measurement, analysis, attribution, and presentation of application performance for both sequential and parallel programs. HPCTOOLKIT can pinpoint and quantify scalability bottlenecks in fully optimized parallel programs with a measurement overhead of only a few percent. Recently, new capabilities were added to HPCTOOLKIT for collecting call path profiles for fully optimized codes without any compiler support, pinpointing and quantifying bottlenecks in multithreaded programs, exploring performance information and source code using a new user interface, and displaying hierarchical space–time diagrams based on traces of asynchronous call path samples. This paper provides an overview of HPCTOOLKIT and illustrates its utility for performance analysis of parallel applications.},

abstract = {An intrusion detection evaluation test bed was developed which generated normal traffic similar to that on a government site containing 100's of users on 1000's of hosts. More than 300 instances of 38 different automated attacks were launched against victim UNIX hosts in seven weeks of training data and two weeks of test data. Six research groups participated in a blind evaluation and results were analyzed for probe, denial-of-service (DoS) remote-to-local (R2L), and user to root (U2R) attacks. The best systems detected old attacks included in the training data, at moderate detection rates ranging from 63% to 93% at a false alarm rate of 10 false alarms per day. Detection rates were much worse for new and novel R2L and DoS attacks included only in the test data. The best systems failed to detect roughly half these new attacks which included damaging access to root-level privileges by remote users. These results suggest that further research should focus on developing techniques to find new attacks instead of extending existing rule-based approaches},

@article{Livshits2009,
abstract = {The last several years have seen a proliferation of static and runtime analysis tools for finding security violations that are caused by explicit information flow in programs. Much of this interest has been caused by the increase in the number of vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting and SQL injection. In fact, these explicit information flow vulnerabilities commonly found in Web applications now outnumber vulnerabilities such as buffer overruns common in type-unsafe languages such as C and C++. Tools checking for these vulnerabilities require a specification to operate. In most cases the task of providing such a specification is delegated to the user. Moreover, the efficacy of these tools is only as good as the specification. Unfortunately, writing a comprehensive specification presents a major challenge: parts of the specification are easy to miss, leading to missed vulnerabilities; similarly, incorrect specifications may lead to false positives. This paper proposes Merlin, a new approach for automatically inferring explicit information flow specifications from program code. Such specifications greatly reduce manual labor, and enhance the quality of results, while using tools that check for security violations caused by explicit information flow. Beginning with a data propagation graph, which represents interprocedural flow of information in the program, Merlin aims to automatically infer an information flow specification. Merlin models information flow paths in the propagation graph using probabilistic constraints. A naive modeling requires an exponential number of constraints, one per path in the propagation graph. For scalability, we approximate these path constraints using constraints on chosen triples of nodes, resulting in a cubic number of constraints. We characterize this approximation as a probabilistic abstraction, using the theory of probabilistic refinement developed by McIver and Morgan. We solve the resulting system of probabilistic constraints using factor graphs, which are a well-known structure for performing probabilistic inference. We experimentally validate the Merlin approach by applying it to 10 large business-critical Web applications that have been analyzed with CAT.NET, a state-of-the-art static analysis tool for .NET. We find a total of 167 new confirmed specifications, which result in a total of 322 additional vulnerabilities across the 10 benchmarks. More accurate specifications also reduce the false positive rate: in our experiments, Merlin-inferred specifications result in 13 false positives being removed; this constitutes a 15% reduction in the CAT.NET false positive rate on these 10 programs. The final false positive rate for CAT.NET after applying Merlin in our experiments drops to under 1%.},

abstract = {A great deal of research on sanitizer placement, sanitizer correctness, checking path validity, and policy inference, has been done in the last five to ten years, involving type systems, static analysis and runtime monitoring and enforcement. However, in pretty much all work thus far, the burden of sanitizer placement has fallen on the developer. However, sanitizer placement in large-scale applications is difficult, and developers are likely to make errors, and thus create security vulnerabilities. This paper advocates a radically different approach: we aim to fully automate the placement of sanitizers by analyzing the ow of tainted data in the program. We argue that developers are better off leaving out sanitizers entirely instead of trying to place them. This paper proposes a fully automatic technique for sanitizer placement. Placement is static whenever possible, switching to run time when necessary. Run-time taint tracking techniques can be used to track the source of a value, and thus apply appropriate sanitization. However, due to the runtime overhead of run-time taint tracking, our technique avoids it wherever possible.},

abstract = {We address the non-redundant random generation of k words of length n in a context-free language. Additionally, we want to avoid a predefined set of words. We study a rejection-based approach, whose worst-case time complexity is shown to grow exponentially with k for some specifications and in the limit case of a coupon collector. We propose two algorithms respectively based on the recursive method and on an unranking approach. We show how careful implementations of these algorithms allow for a non-redundant generation of k words of length n in O ( k ⋅ n ⋅ log n ) arithmetic operations, after a precomputation of $\Theta$ ( n ) numbers. The overall complexity is therefore dominated by the generation of k words, and the non-redundancy comes at a negligible cost.},

@article{Madeira2004,
abstract = {A large number of clustering approaches have been proposed for the analysis of gene expression data obtained from microarray experiments. However, the results from the application of standard clustering methods to genes are limited. This limitation is imposed by the existence of a number of experimental conditions where the activity of genes is uncorrelated. A similar limitation exists when clustering of conditions is performed. For this reason, a number of algorithms that perform simultaneous clustering on the row and column dimensions of the data matrix has been proposed. The goal is to find submatrices, that is, subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions, where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities for every condition. In this paper, we refer to this class of algorithms as biclustering. Biclustering is also referred in the literature as coclustering and direct clustering, among others names, and has also been used in fields such as information retrieval and data mining. In this comprehensive survey, we analyze a large number of existing approaches to biclustering, and classify them in accordance with the type of biclusters they can find, the patterns of biclusters that are discovered, the methods used to perform the search, the approaches used to evaluate the solution, and the target applications.},

abstract = {Measurement of software security is a long-standing challenge to the research community. At the same time, practical security metrics and measurements are essential for secure software development. Hence, the need for metrics is more pressing now due to a growing demand for secure software. In this paper, we propose using a software system's attack surface measurement as an indicator of the system's security. We formalize the notion of a system's attack surface and introduce an attack surface metric to measure the attack surface in a systematic manner. Our measurement method is agnostic to a software system's implementation language and is applicable to systems of all sizes; we demonstrate our method by measuring the attack surfaces of small desktop applications and large enterprise systems implemented in C and Java. We conducted three exploratory empirical studies to validate our method. Software developers can mitigate their software's security risk by measuring and reducing their software's attack surfaces. Our attack surface reduction approach complements the software industry's traditional code quality improvement approach for security risk mitigation and is useful in multiple phases of the software development lifecycle. Our collaboration with SAP demonstrates the use of our metric in the software development process.},

Witten (1984) is capable of very high compression rates, encoding English text in as little as 2.2 b/character. It is shown that the estimates made by Cleary and Witten of the resources required to implement the scheme can be revised to allow for a tractable and useful implementation. In particular, a variant is described that encodes and decodes at over 4 kB/s on a small workstation and operates within a few hundred kilobytes of data space, but still obtains compression of about 2.4 b/character for English text},

Current methods support trustworthy proofs of the correctness of programs for one such specification. However, these methods provide little or no support for reusing proofs of the same algorithm implemented in different machine languages. We describe an approach, based on proof-producing decompilation, which both makes machine-code verification tractable and supports proof reuse between different languages. We briefly present examples based on detailed models of machine code for ARM, PowerPC and x86. The theories and tools have been implemented in the HOL4 system.},

Our improvements make decompilation simpler, faster and more generally applicable. In particular, the new technique allows the veriﬁer to avoid tedious reasoning directly in the underlying machine-code Hoare logic or the model of the instruction set architecture. The method described in this paper has been implemented in the HOL4 theorem prover.},

abstract = {Dynamic Information Flow Tracking (DIFT) is a promising technique for detecting software attacks. Due to the computationally intensive nature of the technique, prior efficient implementations [21, 6] rely on specialized hardware support whose only purpose is to enable DIFT. Alternatively, prior software implementations are either too slow [17, 15] resulting in execution time increases as much as four fold for SPEC integer programs or they are not transparent [31] requiring source code modifications. In this paper, we propose the use of chip multiprocessors (CMP) to perform DIFT transparently and efficiently. We spawn a helper thread that is scheduled on a separate core and is only responsible for performing information flow tracking operations. This entails the communication of registers and flags between the main and helper threads. We explore software (shared memory) and hardware (dedicated interconnect) approaches to enable this communication. Finally, we propose a novel application of the DIFT infrastructure where, in addition to the detection of the software attack, DIFT assists in the process of identifying the cause of the bug in the code that enabled the exploit in the first place. We conducted detailed simulations to evaluate the overhead for performing DIFT and found that to be 48 % for SPEC integer programs.},

note = {{Like the Windows paper, this paper focuses on access control policies specifically. It uses something like Datalog, although it has support for some additional features, such as negation and basic math (with restrictions on how they are used, so as to preserve fixpoint semantics). They gather access control data from a Windows XP and SELinux system in a standard configuration, then codify these as Datalog-ish facts. They then apply OS specific rules that describe the access control behavior of the target system. Then they check that no high-level policies are violated. These policies include things like "one should not be able to write to something executed by admin if one is not an admin", and other such rules. The nice thing about this approach is that they actually can check whether vulnerabilities exist and get real data, rather than just discussing ease of use of the attack surface information, or something similar.
Another paper (EON) says this paper cannot find "vulnerabilities that are exploited dynamically". I believe this refers to the fact that many systems allow you to dynamically change your privilege (downgrade or upgrade integrity levels and such).},

note = {{MulVAL is a system for reasoning about attacks against a network. One first populates a Datalog database with facts about known vulnerabilities, such as which service it affects, whether it can be done remotely, and what the impact is (privilege escalation, denial of service, etc.). This data is generated using OVAL scanners. Information about the network topology is then also added to the database as Datalog facts. Finally, one records information about network facing programs in the system (I believe this is done via some sort of scanner). It looks like they intend for user permission information to also be added to the system by hand.




Once the facts are in the database, they propagate attack capabilities as one might expect. For example, if user A can execute code on machine 1, and machine 1 can communicate with machine 2, then user A can communicate with machine 2. They have a fairly sensible set of rules. They all have a networking theme to them, but they are not too far off from being usable in other scenarios. Unsurprisingly, the evaluation is very lackluster and really only talks about runtime performance. There is no real evaluation of system utility.




In the MulVAL thesis, they discuss how the Datalog component of their system is sound and complete.},

abstract = {Random mutational fuzz testing (fuzzing) and symbolic executions are program testing techniques that have been gaining popularity in the security research community. Fuzzing finds bugs in a target program by natively executing it with random inputs while monitoring the execution for abnormal behaviors such as crashes. While fuzzing may have a reputation of being able to explore deep into a program's state space efficiently, naive fuzzers usually have limited code coverage for typical programs since unconstrained random inputs are unlikely to drive the execution down many different paths. In contrast, symbolic execution tests a program by treating the program's input as symbols and interpreting the program over such symbolic inputs. Although in theory symbolic execution is guaranteed to be effective in achieving code coverage if we explore all possible paths, this generally requires exponential resource and is thus not practical for many real-world programs.\r\n\r\nThis thesis presents our attempt to attain the best of both worlds by combining fuzzing with symbolic execution in a novel manner. Our technique, called hybrid fuzzing, first uses symbolic execution to discover frontier nodes that represent unique paths in the program. After collecting as many frontier nodes as possible under a user-specifiable resource constraint, it transits to fuzz the program with preconditioned random inputs, which are provably random inputs that respect the path predicate leading to each frontier node. Our current implementation supports programs with linear path predicates and can automatically generate preconditioned random inputs from a polytope model of the input space extracted from binaries. These preconditioned random inputs can then be used with any fuzzer. Experiments show that our implementation is efficient in both time and space, and the inputs generated by it are able to gain extra breadth and depth over previous approaches.},

abstract = {One of the main challenges of dynamic symbolic execution--an automated program analysis technique which has been successfully employed to test a variety of software--is constraint solving. A key decision in the design of a symbolic execution tool is the choice of a constraint solver. While different solvers have different strengths, for most queries, it is not possible to tell in advance which solver will perform better. In this paper, we argue that symbolic execution tools can, and should, make use of multiple constraint solvers. These solvers can be run competitively in parallel, with the symbolic execution engine using the result from the best-performing solver. We present empirical data obtained by running the symbolic execution engine KLEE on a set of real programs, and use it to highlight several important characteristics of the constraint solving queries generated during symbolic execution. In particular, we show the importance of constraint caching and counterexample values on the (relative) performance of KLEE configured to use different SMT solvers. We have implemented multi-solver support in KLEE, using the metaSMT framework, and explored how different state-of-the-art solvers compare on a large set of constraint-solving queries. We also report on our ongoing experience building a parallel portfolio solver in KLEE.},

abstract = {Return-oriented programming (ROP) has become the primary exploitation technique for system compromise in the presence of non-executable page protections. ROP exploits are facilitated mainly by the lack of complete address space randomization coverage or the presence of memory disclosure vulnerabilities, necessitating ad- ditional ROP-specific mitigations. In this paper we present a practical runtime ROP ex- ploit prevention technique for the protection of third- party applications. Our approach is based on the detec- tion of abnormal control transfers that take place during ROP code execution. This is achieved using hardware features of commodity processors, which incur negli- gible runtime overhead and allow for completely trans- parent operation without requiring any modifications to the protected applications. Our implementation forWin- dows 7, named kBouncer, can be selectively enabled for installed programs in the same fashion as user-friendly mitigation toolkits likeMicrosoft's EMET. The results of our evaluation demonstrate that kBouncer has low run- time overhead of up to 4%, when stressed with specially crafted workloads that continuously trigger its core de- tection component, while it has negligible overhead for actual user applications. In our experiments with in-the- wild ROP exploits, kBouncer successfully protected all tested applications, including Internet Explorer, Adobe Flash Player, and Adobe Reader. 1},

abstract = {The standard loader (ld.so) is a common target of attacks. The loader is a trusted component of the application, and faults in the loader are problematic, e.g., they may lead to local privilege escalation for SUID binaries. Software-based fault isolation (SFI) provides a framework to execute arbitrary code while protecting the host system. A problem of current approaches to SFI is that fault isolation is decoupled from the dynamic loader, which is treated as a black box. The sandbox has no information about the (expected) execution behavior of the application and the connections between different shared objects. As a consequence, SFI is limited in its ability to identify devious application behavior. This paper presents a new approach to run untrusted code in a user-space sandbox. The approach replaces the standard loader with a security-aware trusted loader. The secure loader and the sandbox together cooperate to allow controlled execution of untrusted programs. A secure loader makes security a first class concept and ensures that the SFI system does not allow any unchecked code to be executed. The user-space sandbox builds on the secure loader and subsequently dynamically checks for malicious code and ensures that all control flow instructions of the application adhere to an execution model. The combination of the secure loader and the user-space sandbox enables the safe execution of untrusted code in user-space. Code injection attacks are stopped before any unintended code is executed. Furthermore, additional information provided by the loader can be used to support additional security properties, e.g., in lining of Procedure Linkage Table calls reduces the number of indirect control flow transfers and therefore limits jump-oriented attacks. This approach implements a secure platform for privileged applications and applications reachable over the network that anticipates and confines security threats from the beginning.},

abstract = {Many real-world programs take highly structured and complex files as inputs. The automated testing of such programs is non-trivial. If the test does not adhere to a specific file format, the program returns a parser error. For symbolic execution-based whitebox fuzzing the corresponding error handling code becomes a significant time sink. Too much time is spent in the parser exploring too many paths lead-ing to trivial parser errors. Naturally, the time is better spent explor-ing the functional part of the program where failure with valid input exposes deep and real bugs in the program. In this paper, we suggest to leverage information about the file format and data chunks of existing, valid files to swiftly carry the exploration beyond the parser code. We call our approach Model-based Whitebox Fuzzing (MoWF) because the file format input model of blackbox fuzzers can be exploited as a constraint on the vast input space to rule out most invalid inputs during path explo-ration in symbolic execution. We evaluate on 13 vulnerabilities in 8 large program binaries with 6 separate file formats and found that MoWF exposes all vulnerabilities while both, traditional whitebox fuzzing and model-based blackbox fuzzing, expose only less than half, respectively. Our experiments also demonstrate that MoWF exposes 70% vulnerabilities without any seed inputs.},

abstract = {Websites commonly use HTTPS to protect their users' private data from network- based attackers. By combining public social network profiles with TLS traffic analysis, we present a new attack that reveals the precise identities of users accessing major websites. As a counter- measure, we propose a novel length-hiding scheme that leverages standard TLS padding to enforce website-specific privacy policies. We present several implementations of this scheme, notably a patch for GnuTLS that offers a rich length-hiding API and an Apache module that uses this API to enforce an anonymity policy for sensitive user files. Our implementations are the first to fully exercise the length-hiding features of TLS and our work uncovers hidden timing assumptions in recent formal proofs of these features. Compared to previous work, we offer the first countermea- sure that is standards-based, provably secure, and experimentally effective, yet pragmatic, offering websites a precise trade-off between user privacy and bandwidth efficienc},

abstract = {As modern operating systems and software become larger and more complex, they are more likely to contain bugs, which may allow attackers to gain illegitimate access. A fast and reliable mechanism to discern and generate vaccines for such attacks is vital for the successful protection of networks and systems. In this paper we present Argos, a containment environment for worms as well as human orchestrated attacks. Argos is built upon a fast x86 emulator which tracks network data throughout execution to identify their invalid use as jump targets, function addresses, instructions, etc. Furthermore, system call policies disallow the use of network data as arguments to certain calls. When an attack is detected, we perform 'intelligent' process- or kernel-aware logging of the corresponding emulator state for further offline processing. In addition, our own forensics shellcode is injected, replacing the malevolent shellcode, to gather information about the attacked process. By correlating the data logged by the emulator with the data collected from the network, we are able to generate accurate network intrusion detection signatures for the exploits that are immune to payload mutations. The entire process can be automated and has few if any false positives, thus rapid global scale deployment of the signatures is possible.},

@inproceedings{Reynolds2002,
abstract = {In joint work with Peter O'Hearn and others, based on early ideas of Burstall, we have developed an extension of Hoare logic that permits reasoning about low-level imperative programs that use shared mutable data structure. The simple imperative programming language is extended with commands (not expressions) for accessing and modifying shared structures, and for explicit allocation and deallocation of storage. Assertions are extended by introducing a "separating conjunction" that asserts that its subformulas hold for disjoint parts of the heap, and a closely related "separating implication". Coupled with the inductive definition of predicates on abstract data structures, this extension permits the concise and flexible description of structures with controlled sharing. In this paper, we survey the current development of this program logic, including extensions that permit unrestricted address arithmetic, dynamically allocated arrays, and recursive procedures. We also discuss promising future directions.},

@inproceedings{Rinard2004,
abstract = {We present a new technique, failure-oblivious computing, that enables servers to execute through memory errors without memory corruption. Our safe compiler for C inserts checks that dynamically detect invalid memory accesses. Instead of terminating or throwing an exception, the generated code simply discards invalid writes and manufactures values to return for invalid reads, enabling the server to continue its normal execution path. We have applied failure-oblivious computing to a set of widely-used servers from the Linux-based open-source computing environment. Our results show that our techniques 1) make these servers invulnerable to known security attacks that exploit memory errors, and 2) enable the servers to continue to operate successfully to service legitimate requests and satisfy the needs of their users even after attacks trigger their memory errors. We observed several reasons for this successful continued execution. When the memory errors occur in irrelevant computations, failure-oblivious computing enables the server to execute through the memory errors to continue on to execute the relevant computation. Even when the memory errors occur in relevant computations, failure-oblivious computing converts requests that trigger unanticipated and dangerous execution paths into anticipated invalid inputs, which the error-handling logic in the server rejects. Because servers tend to have small error propagation distances (localized errors in the computation for one request tend to have little or no effect on the computations for subsequent requests), redirecting reads that would otherwise cause addressing errors and discarding writes that would otherwise corrupt critical data structures (such as the call stack) localizes the effect of the memory errors, prevents addressing exceptions from terminating the computation, and enables the server to continue on to successfully process subsequent requests. The overall result is a substantial extension of the range of requests that the server can successfully process.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with computing graph edit distance. One of the criticisms that can be leveled at existing methods for computing graph edit distance is that they lack some of the formality and rigor of the computation of string edit distance. Hence, our aim is to convert graphs to string sequences so that string matching techniques can be used. To do this, we use a graph spectral seriation method to convert the adjacency matrix into a string or sequence order. We show how the serial ordering can be established using the leading eigenvector of the graph adjacency matrix. We pose the problem of graph-matching as a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) alignment of the seriation sequences for pairs of graphs. This treatment leads to an expression in which the edit cost is the negative logarithm of the a posteriori sequence alignment probability. We compute the edit distance by finding the sequence of string edit operations which minimizes the cost of the path traversing the edit lattice. The edit costs are determined by the components of the leading eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix and by the edge densities of the graphs being matched. We demonstrate the utility of the edit distance on a number of graph clustering problems.},

abstract = {The advent ofmassively open online courses (MOOCs) poses several technical challenges for educators. One of these chal- lenges is the need to automate, as much as possible, the generation of problems, creation of solutions, and grading, in order to deal with the huge number of students. We col- lectively refer to this challenge as automated exercise gen- eration. In this paper, we present a step towards tackling this challenge for an embedded systems course. We present a template-based approach to classifying problems in a re- cent textbook by Lee and Seshia, and outline approaches to problem and solution generation based on mutation and satisfiability solving. Several directions for future work are also outlined.},

abstract = {We introduce a new technique, that we call punctured programs, to apply indistinguishability obfuscation towards cryptographic problems. We use this technique to carry out a systematic study of the applicability of indistinguishability obfuscation to a variety of cryptographic goals. Along the way, we resolve the 16-year-old open question of Deniable Encryption, posed by Canetti, Dwork, Naor, and Ostrovsky in 1997: In deniable encryption, a sender who is forced to reveal to an adversary both her message and the randomness she used for encrypting it should be able to convincingly provide "fake" randomness that can explain any alternative message that she would like to pretend that she sent. We resolve this question by giving the first construction of deniable encryption that does not require any pre-planning by the party that must later issue denial. In addition, we show the generality of our punctured programs technique by also construction variety of core cryptographic objects from indistinguishability obfuscation and one-way functions (or close variants.) In particular we obtain: public key encryption, short "hash-and-sign" selective secure signatures, chosen-ciphertext secure public key encryption, non-interactive zero knowledge proofs (NIZKs), injective trapdor functionos, and oblivious transfer. There results suggest the possibility of indistinguishability obfuscation becoming a "central hub" for cryptography.},

In this paper, we describe the first system for exploring the execution space of JavaScript code using symbolic execution. To handle JavaScript code&#x02019;s complex use of string operations, we design a new language of string constraints and implement a solver for it. We build an automatic end-to-end tool, Kudzu, and apply it to the problem of finding client-side code injection vulnerabilities. In experiments on 18 live web applications, Kudzu automatically discovers 2 previously unknown vulnerabilities and 9 more that were previously found only with a manually-constructed test suite.},

@article{Scholz2008,
abstract = {Bug-checking tools have been used with some success in recent years to find bugs in software. For finding bugs that can cause security vulnerabilities, bug checking tools require a program analysis which determines whether a software bug can be controlled by user-input. In this paper we introduce a static program analysis for computing user-input dependencies. This analysis can be used as a pre-processing filter to a static bug checking tool for identifying bugs that can potentially be exploited as security vulnerabilities. In order for the analysis to be applicable to large commercial software in the millions of lines of code, runtime speed and scalability of the user-input dependence analysis is of key importance. Our user-input dependence analysis takes both data and control dependencies into account. We extend static single assignment (SSA) form by augmenting phi-nodes with control dependencies. A formal definition of user-input dependence is expressed in a dataflow analysis framework as a meet-over-all-paths (MOP) solution. We reduce the equation system to a sparse equation system exploiting the properties of SSA. The sparse equation system is solved as a reachability problem that results in a fast algorithm for computing user-input dependencies. We have implemented a call-insensitive and a call-sensitive analysis. The paper gives preliminary results on the comparison of their efficiency for various benchmarks.},

abstract = {Code reuse attacks such as return-oriented programming (ROP) have become prevalent techniques to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in software programs. A variety of corresponding defenses has been proposed, of which some have already been successfully bypassed -- and the arms race continues. In this paper, we perform a systematic assessment of recently proposed CFI solutions and other defenses against code reuse attacks in the context of C++. We demonstrate that many of these defenses that do not consider object-oriented C++ semantics precisely can be generically bypassed in practice. Our novel attack technique, denoted as counterfeit object-oriented programming (COOP), induces malicious program behavior by only invoking chains of existing C++ virtual functions in a program through corresponding existing call sites. COOP is Turing complete in realistic attack scenarios and we show its viability by developing sophisticated, real-world exploits for Internet Explorer 10 on Windows and Fire fox 36 on Linux. Moreover, we show that even recently proposed defenses (CPS, T-VIP, vfGuard, and VTint) that specifically target C++ are vulnerable to COOP. We observe that constructing defenses resilient to COOP that do not require access to source code seems to be challenging. We believe that our investigation and results are helpful contributions to the design and implementation of future defenses against control flow hijacking attacks.},

abstract = {Machine code disassembly routines form a fundamental component of software systems that statically analyze or modify executable programs, e.g., reverse engineering systems, static binary translators, and link-time optimizers. The task of disassembly is complicated by indirect jumps and the presence of non-executable data - jump tables, alignment bytes, etc. - in the instruction stream. Existing disassembly algorithms are not always able to cope successfully with executable files containing such features, and they fail silently - i.e., produce incorrect disassemblies without any indication that the results they are producing are incorrect. In this paper we examine two commonly-used disassembly algorithms and illustrate their shortcomings. We propose a hybrid approach that performs better than these algorithms in the sense that it is able to detect situations where the disassembly may be incorrect and limit the extent of such disassembly errors. Experimental results indicate that the algorithm is quite effective: the amount of code flagged as incurring disassembly errors is usually quite small.},

abstract = {Dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) has been proposed recently to effectively generate test inputs for real-world programs. Unfortu-nately, dynamic symbolic execution techniques do not scale well for large realistic programs, because often the number of feasible execution paths of a program increases exponentially with the in-crease in the length of an execution path. In this paper, we propose MULTISE, a new technique for merg-ing states incrementally during symbolic execution, without using auxiliary variables. The key idea of MULTISE is based on an al-ternative representation of the state, where we map each variable, including the program counter, to a set of guarded symbolic expres-sions called a value summary. MULTISE has several advantages over conventional DSE and state merging techniques: 1) value sum-maries enable sharing of symbolic expressions and path constraints along multiple paths, 2) value-summaries avoid redundant execu-tion, 3) MULTISE does not introduce auxiliary symbolic values, which enables it to make progress even when merging values not supported by the constraint solver, such as floating point or function values.

abstract = {Address-space randomization is a technique used to fortify systems against buffer overflow attacks. The idea is to introduce artificial diversity by randomizing the memory location of certain system components. This mechanism is available for both Linux (via PaX ASLR) and OpenBSD. We study the effectiveness of address-space randomization and find that its utility on 32-bit architectures is limited by the number of bits available for address randomization. In particular, we demonstrate a derandomization attack that will convert any standard buffer-overflow exploit into an exploit that works against systems protected by address-space randomization. The resulting exploit is as effective as the original exploit, although it takes a little longer to compromise a target machine: on average 216 seconds to compromise Apache running on a Linux PaX ASLR system. The attack does not require running code on the stack. We also explore various ways of strengthening address-space randomization and point out weaknesses in each. Surprisingly, increasing the frequency of re-randomizations adds at most 1 bit of security. Furthermore, compile-time randomization appears to be more effective than runtime randomization. We conclude that, on 32-bit architectures, the only benefit of PaX-like address-space randomization is a small slowdown in worm propagation speed.

State-of-the-art malware analyzers discover code guarded by triggers via multiple path exploration, symbolic execution, or forced conditional execution, all without knowing the trigger inputs. We present a malware obfuscation technique that automatically conceals specific trigger-based behavior from these malware analyzers. Our technique automatically transforms a program by encrypting code that is conditionally dependent on an input value with a key derived from the input and then removing the key from the program. We have implemented a compiler-level tool that takes a malware source program and automatically generates an obfuscated binary. Experiments on various existing malware samples show that our tool can hide a significant portion of trigger based code. We provide insight into the strengths, weaknesses, and possible ways to strengthen current analysis approaches in order to defeat this malware obfuscation technique.},

abstract = {—Embedded devices have become ubiquitous, and they are used in a range of privacy-sensitive and security-critical applications. Most of these devices run proprietary software, and little documentation is available about the software's inner workings. In some cases, the cost of the hardware and protection mechanisms might make access to the devices themselves infeasible. Analyzing the software that is present in such environments is challenging, but necessary, if the risks associated with software bugs and vulnerabilities must be avoided. As a matter of fact, recent studies revealed the presence of backdoors in a number of embedded devices available on the market. In this paper, we present Firmalice, a binary analysis framework to support the analysis of firmware running on embedded devices. Firmalice builds on top of a symbolic execution engine, and techniques, such as program slicing, to increase its scalability. Furthermore, Firmalice utilizes a novel model of authentication bypass flaws, based on the attacker's ability to determine the required inputs to perform privileged operations. We evaluated Firmalice on the firmware of three commercially-available devices, and were able to detect authentication bypass backdoors in two of them. Additionally, Firmalice was able to determine that the backdoor in the third firmware sample was not exploitable by an attacker without knowledge of a set of unprivileged credentials.},

abstract = {Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in binary code is a challenging task. The lack of high-level, semantically rich information about data structures and control constructs makes the analysis of program properties harder to scale. However, the importance of binary analysis is on the rise. In many situations binary analysis is the only possible way to prove (or disprove) properties about the code that is actually executed. In this paper, we present a binary analysis framework that implements a number of analysis techniques that have been proposed in the past. We present a systematized implementation of these techniques, which allows other researchers to compose them and develop new approaches. In addition, the implementation of these techniques in a unifying framework allows for the direct comparison of these apporaches and the identification of their advantages and disadvantages. The evaluation included in this paper is performed using a recent dataset created by DARPA for evaluating the effectiveness of binary vulnerability analysis techniques. Our framework has been open-sourced and is available to the security community.},

abstract = {We present a new technique that enables software recovery in legacy applications by retrofitting exception-handling capabilities, error virtualization using rescue points. We introduce the idea of "rescue points" as program locations to which an application can recover its execution in the presence of failures. The use of rescue points reduces the chance of unanticipated execution paths thereby making recovery more robust by mimicking system behavior under controlled error conditions. These controlled error conditions can be thought of as a set erroneous inputs, like the ones used by most quality-assurance teams during software development, designed to stress-test an application. To discover rescue points applications are profiled and monitored during tests that bombard the program with bad/random inputs. The intuition is that by monitoring application behavior during these runs, we gain insight into how programmer-tested program points are used to propagate faults gracefully.},

@article{Singh2012,
abstract = {We propose computer-assisted techniques for helping with pedagogy in Algebra. In particular, given a proof problem p (of the form Left-hand-side-term = Right- hand-side-term), we show how to automatically gener- ate problems that are similar to p.We believe that such a tool can be used by teachers in making examinations where they need to test students on problems similar to what they taught in class, and by students in generating practice problems tailored to their specific needs. Our first insight is that we can generalize p syntactically to a query Q that implicitly represents a set of problems [[Q]] (which includes p). Our second insight is that we can explore the space of problems [[Q]] automatically, use classical results from polynomial identity testing to generate only those problems in [[Q]] that are correct, and then use pruning techniques to generate only unique and interesting problems. Our third insight is that with a small amount of manual tuning on the query Q, the user can interactively guide the computer to generate problems of interest to her.We present the technical de- tails of the above mentioned steps, and also describe a tool where these steps have been implemented. We also present an empirical evaluation on a wide variety of problems from various sub-fields of algebra includ- ing polynomials, trigonometry, calculus, determinants etc. Our tool is able to generate a rich corpus of similar problems from each given problem; while some of these similar problems were already present in the textbook, several were new!},

@inproceedings{Srinivasan2004,
abstract = {Software robustness has significant impact on system availability. Unfortunately, finding software bugs is a very challenging task because many bugs are hard to reproduce. While debugging a program, it would be very useful to rollback a crashed program to a previous execution point and deterministically re-execute the "buggy" code region. However, most previous work on rollback and replay support was designed to survive hardware or operating system failures, and is therefore too heavyweight for the fine-grained rollback and replay needed for software debugging. This paper presents Flashback, a lightweight OS extension that provides fine-grained rollback and replay to help debug software. Flashback uses shadow processes to efficiently roll back in-memory state of a process, and logs a process' interactions with the system to support deterministic replay. Both shadow processes and logging of system calls are implemented in a lightweight fashion specifically designed for the purpose of software debugging. We have implemented a prototype of Flashback in the Linux operating system. Our experimental results with micro-benchmarks and real applications show that Flashback adds little overhead and can quickly roll back a debugged program to a previous execution point and deterministically replay from that point.},

abstract = {Web applications typically interact with a back-end database to retrieve persistent data and then present the data to the user as dynamically generated output, such as HTML web pages. However, this interaction is commonly done through a low-level API by dynamically constructing query strings within a general-purpose programming language, such as Java. This low-level interaction is ad hoc because it does not take into account the structure of the output language. Accordingly, user inputs are treated as isolated lexical entities which, if not properly sanitized, can cause the web application to generate unintended output. This is called a command injection attack, which poses a serious threat to web application security. This paper presents the first formal definition of command injection attacks in the context of web applications, and gives a sound and complete algorithm for preventing them based on context-free grammars and compiler parsing techniques. Our key observation is that, for an attack to succeed, the input that gets propagated into the database query or the output document must change the intended syntactic structure of the query or document. Our definition and algorithm are general and apply to many forms of command injection attacks. We validate our approach with SqlCheckS, an implementation for the setting of SQL command injection attacks. We evaluated SqlCheckS on real-world web applications with systematically compiled real-world attack data as input. SqlCheckS produced no false positives or false negatives, incurred low runtime overhead, and applied straightforwardly to web applications written in different languages.},

abstract = {Many clone detection tools have been proposed in the literature. However, our knowledge of their performance in real software systems is limited, particularly their recall. In this paper, we use our big data clone benchmark, BigCloneBench, to evaluate the recall of ten clone detection tools. BigCloneBench is a collection of eight million validated clones within IJaDataset-2.0, a big data software repository containing 25,000 open-source Java systems. BigCloneBench contains both intra-project and inter-project clones of the four primary clone types. We use this benchmark to evaluate the recall of the tools per clone type and across the entire range of clone syntactical similarity. We evaluate the tools for both single-system and cross-project detection scenarios. Using multiple clone-matching metrics, we evaluate the quality of the tools' reporting of the benchmark clones with respect to refactoring and automatic clone analysis use-cases. We compare these real-world results against our Mutation and Injection Framework, a synthetic benchmark, to reveal deeper understanding of the tools. We found that the tools have strong recall for Type-1 and Type-2 clones, as well as Type-3 clones with high syntactical similarity. The tools have weaker detection of clones with lower syntactical similarity.},

abstract = {Memory corruption bugs in software written in low-level languages like C or C++ are one of the oldest problems in computer security. The lack of safety in these languages allows attackers to alter the program's behavior or take full control over it by hijacking its control flow. This problem has existed for more than 30 years and a vast number of potential solutions have been proposed, yet memory corruption attacks continue to pose a serious threat. Real world exploits show that all currently deployed protections can be defeated. This paper sheds light on the primary reasons for this by describing attacks that succeed on today's systems. We systematize the current knowledge about various protection techniques by setting up a general model for memory corrup- tion attacks. Using this model we show what policies can stop which attacks. The model identifies weaknesses of currently deployed techniques, as well as other proposed protections enforcing stricter policies. We analyze the reasons why protection mechanisms imple- menting stricter polices are not deployed. To achieve wide adoption, protection mechanisms must support a multitude of features and must satisfy a host of requirements. Especially important is performance, as experience shows that only solutions whose overhead is in reasonable bounds get deployed. A comparison of different enforceable policies helps de- signers of new protection mechanisms in finding the balance between effectiveness (security) and efficiency.We identify some open research problems, and provide suggestions on improving the adoption of newer techniques.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an almost-linear time algorithm for constructing Gated Single Assignment (GSA), which is SSA augmented with gating functions at &oslash;-nodes. The gating functions specify the control dependences for each reaching definition at a &oslash;-node. We introduce a new concept of gating path, which is path in the control flow graph from the immediate dominator u of a node v to v, such that every node in the path is dominated by u. Previous algorithms start with &oslash;-function placement, and then traverse the control flow graph to compute the gating functions. By formulating the problem into gating path construction, we are able to identify not only a &oslash;-node, but also a gating path expression which defines a gating function for the &oslash;-node.},

We present a feasibility study to show the use of a theorem prover based extended static checker to help code audit to find these vulnerabilities. We employed this tool to uncover around 10 local and remote untrusted code execution vul-nerabilities in three core OS components. We highlight the benefits, the challenges faced and outstanding prob-lems to enable wider use. Additional manual code re-view of remotely exposed software suggests that zero and near-zero allocations are particularly difficult to handle for developers},

@article{Veen2016,
abstract = {Current binary-level Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) techniques are weak in determining the set of valid targets for indirect control flow transfers on the forward edge. In particular, the lack of source code forces existing techniques to resort to a conservative address-taken policy that over-approximates this set. In contrast, source-level solutions can accurately infer the targets of indirect callsites and thus detect malicious control-flow transfers more precisely. Given that source code is not always available, however, offering similar quality of protection at the binary level is important, but, unquestionably, more challenging than ever: recent work demonstrates powerful attacks, such as Counterfeit Object-oriented Programming (COOP), which made the community believe that protecting software against control-flow diversion attacks at the binary level is impossible. In this paper, we propose binary-level analysis techniques to significantly reduce the number of possible targets for indirect callsites. More specifically, we reconstruct a conservative ap-proximation of target function prototypes by means of use-def analysis at possible callees. We then couple this with liveness analysis at each indirect callsite to derive a many-to-many relationship between callsites and target callees with a much higher precision compared to prior binary-level solutions. Experimental results on popular server programs and on SPEC CPU2006 show that TypeArmor, a prototype implemen-tation of our approach, is efficient—with a runtime overhead of less than 3%. Furthermore, we evaluate to what extent TypeArmor can mitigate COOP and other advanced attacks and show that our approach can significantly reduce the number of targets on the forward edge. Moreover, we show that TypeArmor breaks published COOP exploits, providing concrete evidence that strict binary-level CFI can still mitigate advanced attacks, despite the absence of source information or C++ semantics.},

abstract = {Virtualization is being widely adopted in today&#x02019;s computing systems. Its unique security advantages in isolating and introspecting commodity OSes as virtual machines (VMs) have enabled a wide spectrum of applications. However, a common, fundamental assumption is the presence of a trustworthy hypervisor. Unfortunately, the large code base of commodity hypervisors and recent successful hypervisor attacks (e.g., VM escape) seriously question the validity of this assumption. In this paper, we present HyperSafe, a lightweight approach that endows existing Type-I bare-metal hypervisors with a unique self-protection capability to provide lifetime control flow integrity. Specifically, we propose two key techniques. The first one, non-bypassable memory lockdown, reliably protects the hypervisor&#x02019;s code and static data from being compromised even in the presence of exploitable memory corruption bugs (e.g., buffer overflows), therefore successfully providing hypervisor code integrity. The second one, restricted pointer indexing, introduces one layer of indirection to convert the control data into pointer indexes. These pointer indexes are restricted such that the corresponding call/return targets strictly follow the hypervisor control flow graph, hence expanding protection to control-flow integrity. We have built a prototype and used it to protect two open-source Type-I hypervisors: BitVisor and Xen. The experimental results with synthetic hypervisor exploits and benchmarking programs show HyperSafe can reliably enable the hypervisor self-protection and provide the integrity guarantee with a small performance overhead.},

abstract = {—Static binary rewriting has many important ap-plications in reverse engineering, such as patching, code reuse, and instrumentation. Binary reassembling is an efficient solution for static binary rewriting. While there has been a proposed solution to the reassembly of binaries, an evaluation on a real-world binary dataset shows that it suffers from some problems that lead to breaking binaries. Those problems include incorrect symbolization of immediates, failure in identifying symbolizable constants, lack of pointer safety checks, and other issues. Failure in addressing those problems makes the existing approach un-suitable for real-world binaries, especially those compiled with optimizations enabled. In this paper, we present a new systematic approach for binary reassembling. Our new approach is implemented in a tool called Ramblr. We evaluate Ramblr on 106 real-world programs on Linux x86 and x86-64, and 143 programs collected from the Cyber Grand Challenge Qualification Event. All programs are compiled to binaries with a set of different compilation flags in order to cover as many real-world scenarios as possible. Ramblr successfully reassembles most of the binaries, which is an improvement over the state-of-the-art approach. It should be noted that our reassembling procedure yields no execution overhead and no size expansion.},

abstract = {In this work, we unveil new privacy threats against Voice-over-IP (VoIP) communications. Although prior work has shown that the interaction of variable bit-rate codecs and length-preserving stream ciphers leaks information, we show that the threat is more serious than previously thought. In particular, we derive approximate transcripts of encrypted VoIP conversations by segmenting an observed packet stream into subsequences representing individual phonemes and classifying those subsequences by the phonemes they encode. Drawing on insights from the computational linguistics and speech recognition communities, we apply novel techniques for unmasking parts of the conversation. We believe our ability to do so underscores the importance of designing secure (yet efficient) ways to protect the confidentiality of VoIP conversations.},

abstract = {Code clone detection is an important problem for software maintenance and evolution. Many approaches consider ei-ther structure or identifiers, but none of the existing detec-tion techniques model both sources of information. These techniques also depend on generic, handcrafted features to represent code fragments. We introduce learning-based de-tection techniques where everything for representing terms and fragments in source code is mined from the repository. Our code analysis supports a framework, which relies on deep learning, for automatically linking patterns mined at the lexical level with patterns mined at the syntactic level. We evaluated our novel learning-based approach for code clone detection with respect to feasibility from the point of view of software maintainers. We sampled and manually evaluated 398 file-and 480 method-level pairs across eight real-world Java systems; 93% of the file-and method-level samples were evaluated to be true positives. Among the true positives, we found pairs mapping to all four clone types. We compared our approach to a traditional structure-oriented technique and found that our learning-based approach de-tected clones that were either undetected or suboptimally reported by the prominent tool Deckard. Our results affirm that our learning-based approach is suitable for clone detec-tion and a tenable technique for researchers.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of clustering observations using a potentially large set of features. One might expect that the true underlying clusters present in the data differ only with respect to a small fraction of the features, and will be missed if one clusters the observations using the full set of features. We propose a novel framework for sparse clustering, in which one clusters the observations using an adaptively chosen subset of the features. The method uses a lasso-type penalty to select the features. We use this framework to develop simple methods for sparse K-means and sparse hierarchical clustering. A single criterion governs both the selection of the features and the resulting clusters. These approaches are demonstrated on simulated data and on genomic data sets.},

abstract = {Recent work on the foundational underpinnings of black-box optimization has begun to uncover a rich mathematical structure. In particular, it is now known that an inner product between the optimization algorithm and the distribution of optimization problems likely to be encountered fixes the distribution over likely performances in running that algorithm. One ramification of this is the "No Free Lunch" (NFL) theorems, which state that any two algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems. This highlights the need for exploiting problem-specific knowledge to achieve better than random performance. In this paper, we present a general framework covering most optimization scenarios. In addition to the optimization scenarios addressed in the NFL results, this framework covers multiarmed bandit problems and evolution of multiple coevolving players. As a particular instance of the latter, it covers "self-play" problems. In these problems, the set of players work together to produce a champion, who then engages one or more antagonists in a subsequent multiplayer game. In contrast to the traditional optimization case where the NFL results hold, we show that in self-play there are free lunches: in coevolution some algorithms have better performance than other algorithms, averaged across all possible problems. However, in the typical coevolutionary scenarios encountered in biology, where there is no champion, the NFL theorems still hold.},

abstract = {The vast majority of security breaches encountered today are a direct result of insecure code. Consequently, the protection of computer systems critically depends on the rigorous identification of vulnerabilities in software, a tedious and error-prone process requiring significant expertise. Unfortunately, a single flaw suffices to undermine the security of a system and thus the sheer amount of code to audit plays into the attacker's cards. In this paper, we present a method for effectively mining large amounts of source code for vulnerabilities. To this end, we introduce a novel representation of source code called a code property graph that merges concepts of classic program analysis, namely abstract syntax trees, control flow graphs and program dependence graphs, into a joint data structure. This comprehensive representation enables us to elegantly model templates for common vulnerabilities with graph traversals that, for instance, can identify buffer overflows, integer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or memory disclosures. We implement our approach using a popular graph database and demonstrate its efficacy by identifying 18 previously unknown vulnerabilities in the source code of the Linux kernel.},

abstract = {It is becoming increasingly important for applications to protect sensitive data. With current techniques, the programmer bears the burden of ensuring that the application's behavior adheres to policies about where sensitive values may flow. Unfortunately, privacy policies are difficult to manage because their global nature requires coordinated reasoning and enforcement. To address this problem, we describe a programming model that makes the system responsible for ensuring adherence to privacy policies. The programming model has two components: 1) core programs describing functionality independent of privacy concerns and 2) declarative, decentralized policies controlling how sensitive values are disclosed. Each sensitive value encapsulates multiple views; policies describe which views are allowed based on the output context. The system is responsible for automatically ensuring that outputs are consistent with the policies. We have implemented this programming model in a new functional constraint language named Jeeves. In Jeeves, sensitive values are introduced as symbolic variables and policies correspond to constraints that are resolved at output channels. We have implemented Jeeves as a Scala library using an SMT solver as a model finder. In this paper we describe the dynamic and static semantics of Jeeves and the properties about policy enforcement that the semantics guarantees. We also describe our experience implementing a conference management system and a social network.},

abstract = {Fuzz testing has been widely used in practice to detect software vulnerabilities. Traditional fuzzing tools typically use blocks to model program input. Despite the demonstrated success of this approach, its effectiveness is inherently limited when applied to test programs that process grammatical inputs, where the input data are mainly human-readable text with complex structures that are specified by a formal grammar. In this paper we present BlendFuzz, a fuzz testing framework that is grammar-aware. It works by breaking a set of existing test cases into units of grammar components, then using these units as variants to restructure existent test data, resulting in a wider range of test cases that have the potential to explore previously uncovered corner cases when used in testing. We've implemented this framework along with two language fuzzers on top of it. Experiments with these fuzzers have shown improved code coverage, and field testing has revealed over two dozens of previously unreported bugs in real-world applications, with seven of them being medium or high risk zero-day vulnerabilities.},

Native Client aims to give browser-based applications the computational performance of native applications without compromising safety. Native Client uses software fault isolation and a secure runtime to direct system interaction and side effects through interfaces managed by Native Client. Native Client provides operating system portability for binary code while supporting performance-oriented features generally absent from Web application programming environments, such as thread support, instruction set extensions such as SSE, and use of compiler intrinsics and hand-coded assembler. We combine these properties in an open architecture that encourages community review and 3rd-party tools.},

Finally, we apply a widening operator defined on automata\nto approximate fixpoint computations. If this conservative approximation\ndoes not include any bad patterns (specified as regular expressions),\nwe conclude that the program does not contain any errors or vulnerabilities.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that our approach works quite\nwell in checking the correctness of sanitization operations in real-world\nPHP applications.},

abstract = {Low-level Inlined Reference Monitors (IRM) such as control-flow integrity and software-based fault isolation can foil numerous software attacks. Conventionally, those IRMs are implemented through binary rewriting or transformation on equivalent low-level programs that are tightly coupled with a specific Instruction Set Ar- chitecture (ISA). Resulting implementations have poor retargetability to different ISAs. This paper intro- duces an IRM-implementation framework at a com- piler intermediate-representation (IR) level. The IR-level framework enables easy retargetability to different ISAs, but raises the challenge of how to preserve security at the low level, as the compiler backend might invalidate the assumptions at the IR level. We propose a constraint language to encode the assumptions and check whether they still hold after the backend transformations and op- timizations. Furthermore, an independent verifier is im- plemented to validate the security of low-level code. We have implemented the framework inside LLVM to en- force the policy of control-flow integrity and data sand- boxing for both reads and writes. Experimental results demonstrate that it incurs modest runtime overhead of 19.90% and 25.34% on SPECint2000 programs for x86- 32 and x86-64, respectively.},

abstract = {Control Flow Integrity (CFI) provides a strong protection against modern control-flow hijacking attacks. How- ever, performance and compatibility issues limit its adoption. We propose a new practical and realistic protection method called CCFIR (Compact Control Flow Integrity and Random- ization), which addresses the main barriers to CFI adoption. CCFIR collects all legal targets of indirect control-transfer in- structions, puts them into a dedicated “Springboard section” in a random order, and then limits indirect transfers to flow only to them. Using the Springboard section for targets, CCFIR can validate a target more simply and faster than traditional CFI, and provide support for on-site target-randomization as well as better compatibility. Based on these approaches, CCFIR can stop control-flow hijacking attacks including ROP and return- into-libc. Results show that ROP gadgets are all eliminated.We observe that with the wide deployment of ASLR, Windows/x86 PE executables contain enough information in relocation tables which CCFIR can use to find all legal instructions and jump targets reliably, without source code or symbol information. We evaluate our prototype implementation on common web browsers and the SPEC CPU2000 suite: CCFIR protects large applications such as GCC and Firefox completely automati- cally, and has low performance overhead of about 3.6%/8.6% (average/max) using SPECint2000. Experiments on real-world exploits also show that CCFIR-hardened versions of IE6, Firefox 3.6 and other applications are protected effectively.},

abstract = {Analyzing web applications requires reasoning about strings and non-strings cohesively. Existing string solvers either ignore non-string program behavior or support limited set of string operations. In this paper, we develop a general purpose string solver, called Z3-str, as an extension of the Z3 SMT solver through its plug-in interface. Z3-str treats strings as a primitive type, thus avoiding the inherent limitations observed in many existing solvers that encode strings in terms of other primitives. The logic of the plug-in has three sorts, namely, bool, int and string. The string-sorted terms include string constants and variables of arbitrary length, with functions such as concatenation, sub-string, and replace. The int-sorted terms are standard, with the exception of the length function over string terms. The atomic formulas are equations over string terms, and (in)-equalities over integer terms. Not only does our solver have features that enable whole program symbolic, static and dynamic analysis, but also it performs better than other solvers in our experiments. The application of Z3-str in remote code execution detection shows that its support of a wide spectrum of string operations is key to reducing false positives.},

abstract = {To be trustworthy, security-sensitive applications must be formally verified and hence small and simple, i.e., wimpy. Thus, they cannot include a variety of basic services available only in large and untrustworthy commodity systems, i.e., in giants. Hence, wimps must securely compose with giants to survive on commodity systems, i.e., rely on giants' services but only after efficiently verifying their results. This paper presents a security architecture based on a wimpy kernel that provides on-demand isolated I/O channels for wimp applications, without bloating the underlying trusted computing base. The size and complexity of the wimpy kernel are minimized by safely outsourcing I/O subsystem functions to an untrusted commodity operating system and exporting driver and I/O subsystem code to wimp applications. Using the USB subsystem as a case study, this paper illustrates the dramatic reduction of wimpy-kernel size and complexity, e.g., over 99% of the USB code base is removed. Performance measurements indicate that the wimpy-kernel architecture exhibits the desired execution efficiency.},
