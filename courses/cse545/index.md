# Overview

As described in the course name, this course is all about software security.

I am gonna show you security flaws in software, guide you to take advantage
and hack by yourself, and more importantly, show you how to defend.

This class will be the first step for you to become an elite and ethical
hacker.

After taking the class, you will be able to identify software vulnerabilities, understand their impacts. and come up with ways to defend or mitigate the vulnerabilities.

I also hope that this course will help you write programs with less security bugs in your future career.
