In this assignment, you will warm up on bash commands.
This will help you go over essential Linux commands that you will need for this
course.

I'm trying to make it fun, so I decide to invite you to play [the Bandit Game](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).
Your goal is to achieve Level 16 (pass Level 15 -> Level 16 and be able to log
in Level 16).
