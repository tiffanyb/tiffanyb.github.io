title: "Assignment 3: The Stack Smasher"
---

## Deadline: Octobor 31st, 11:59 PM PST

In this assignment, you will be the master of stack and use stack to get the flags.
The goal is to understand stack vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of different defense techniques.

There are two waves in this assignment: Babystack and Babyfmt. The first one is for stack overflow vulnerabilities, and the second one is format string vulnerabilities. We will combine the two parts together for the final score of this
assignment.

The challenges are at [http://asu-cse545.com](http://asu-cse545.com). Similar to Babykey in Assignment 2, your goal is to get the flag and submit to the website.

**The first wave of the challenges (Babystack) is already available.** The second wave is on the way. ;)


## Score Calculation

Babystack contains 10 levels. Each level contains 1 teaching challenge and 2 testing challenges.
Babyfmt contains 7 levels, and each level contains 1 teaching and 1 testing challenge.

In this assignment, **only testing challenges will be scored.**
Each testing challenge is 1 point.
The total score is 25, yet you can get 27 / 25 in maximum.
Try your best to get as much you can!

Although you cannot get score from the teaching challenges, they will be really helpful for you to complete the testing ones!
So if you don't know how to solve a testing challenge, check out the teaching challenge first.
