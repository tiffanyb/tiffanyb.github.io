title: "Execution Semantics and Buffer Overflows"
category: "Software Security"
prof: Vyas
summary: >
  This lecture will review the material up through Chapter 3 of CS:APP 
  from 15-213. We will cover the parts of the compilation tool chain and 
  operations at the assembly level, including control flow, the memory 
  model, and stack frames.
  We will also present control-flow-hijacking attacks that gain 
  control of the instruction pointer, with a focus on buffer overflows.
