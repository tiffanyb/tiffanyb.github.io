title: Return Oriented Programming and Control-Flow Integrity 
category: "Software Security"
prof: Vyas
summary: >
  This lecture will review Return Oriented Programming attacks and Control-Flow Integrity defenses.
  Control Flow Integrity (CFI) is a security property that specifies real 
  executions should follow the static CFG. We will explore CFI, focusing on
  what "the" CFG is.
