  - Security policy -- Ongoing debates!
    - Export laws (FREAK attack!)
    - Key escrow
    - iPhone break for San Berdino, etc.
  - Privacy policy
    - GDPR in Europe (which also affects US companies operating there)
    - In US, very few privacy rights except by sector (FERPA for edu, HIPAA for med)
