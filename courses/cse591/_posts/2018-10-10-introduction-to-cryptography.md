title: Introduction to Cryptography
category: "Crypto"
prof: Bryan
summary: >
  In this lecture we will provide a high-level introduction to 
  cryptography, including an overview of primitives and security models.
  We will touch on the rich power offered by modern cryptographic tools.
  
  Finally, we will discuss (in)secure sources of randomness,
  cover the principles of pseudorandom functions, permutations,
  and introduce the notion of adversarial games to prove security properties 
  of cryptographic constructions.

  Note that the reading below covers topics from the entire Crypto unit,
  so feel free to do the relevant portions of the reading as we go along.
